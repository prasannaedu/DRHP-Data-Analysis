Accounting \nestimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The estimates and \nthe underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Sale of Products \nThe Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers when it satisfies a performance obligation by \ntransferring control of promised good to a customer. Performance obligation in respect of sale of product is satisfied \nat a point in time which usually occurs upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full \ndiscretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect \nthe customer\u2019s acceptance of the product. \nThe revenue is recognised to the extent of transaction price allocated to the performance obligation satisfied. \nTransaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for \ntransferring good to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of a third party. Variable consideration is \nestimated using the expected value method or most likely amount as appropriate in a given circumstance. Payment \nterms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and there is no financing component involved in the \ntransaction price. \nii. Sale of Services \nIn respect of sale of services, performance obligation is satisfied over time when the entity renders services to \ncustomers. Revenue from services rendered is recognised as the services are rendered and is booked based on \nagreement / arrangements with the concerned parties. \nTransaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for \ntransferring service to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of a third party. Variable consideration is \nestimated using the expected value method or most likely amount as appropriate in a given circumstance. Payment \nterms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and there is no financing component involved in the \ntransaction price. Payment terms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and there is no financing \ncomponent involved in the transaction price. \niii. Interest & Dividend Income \nInterest income is recognised on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the \ninterest rate applicable. \nIncome from dividend is recognised when right to receive payment is established. \niv. Other Income \nOther Incomes are accounted as and when the right to receive such income arises and it is probable that the \neconomic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. \n",

If any such indication exists, \nthe assets recoverable amounts are estimated at each reporting date. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value \nless costs to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to \ntheir present value using a pre-discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money \nand the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are \ngrouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely \nindependent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the \u201ccash-generating unit\u201d). An impairment \nloss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or the cash generating unit exceeds the corresponding \nrecoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \nImpairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss \nhas decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used \nto determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying \namount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation, \nif no impairment loss had been recognised.

A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily requires \na substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended \nin the period during which the active development is delayed beyond reasonable time due to other than temporary \ninterruption. All other borrowing costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss as incurred. \nK) Inventories \nInventories of raw materials, components and stores and spare parts are valued at lower of cost and net realisable \nvalue. Cost includes purchase price, duties and taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the Company \nfrom taxing authorities), freight inward and other expenditure in bringing inventories to present locations and \nconditions. In determining the cost, First-in-First-out (FIFO) method is used. The carrying costs of raw materials, \ncomponents and stores and spare parts are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will \nbe incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. \nFinished goods are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The comparison of cost and net realisable \nvalue is made on an item by item basis. Cost comprises of direct material and labour expenses and an appropriate \nportion of production overheads incurred in bringing the inventory to their present location and condition. Fixed \nproduction overheads are allocated on the basis of normal capacity of the production facilities.

Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  \nFinancial Liabilities \nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently \nmeasured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method where the time value of money is significant. \nInterest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently \nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of \ntransaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in \nthe statement of profit and loss. \nDe-recognition of financial liabilities \n",

        "full_text": "Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited (formerly known as Stallion India Fluorochemicals Private Limited) \nNotes to Restated Financial Information \nAnnexure V Basis of Preparation, Significant Accounting Policies \n \nThe Company de-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company\u2019s obligations are discharged, \ncancelled or they expire. The differences between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and \nthe consideration paid is recognized in the Statement of Profit & Loss. \nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting \nThe Company enters into forward contracts and principal and interest swap contracts to hedge its risks associated \nwith foreign currency and variable interest rate fluctuations related to existing financial assets and liabilities, certain \nfirm commitments and forecasted transactions. These derivative contracts are being considered as cash flow hedge. \nThe use of hedging instruments is governed by the Company\u2019s policies approved by the Board of Directors. The \nCompany does not use these contracts for trading or speculative purposes. \nTo designate a forward contract/ swap contract as an effective hedge, management objectively evaluates and \nevidences with appropriate supporting documents at the inception of each contract whether the contract is effective \nin offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. \nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value from the date the derivative contract is entered \ninto and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. \nThe Company adopts hedge accounting for forward and interest rate contracts wherever possible. At the inception \nof each hedge, there is a formal, documented designation of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes, \ninter alia, items such as identification of the hedged item or transaction and the nature of the risk being hedged. At \ninception each hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving an offset of changes in fair value or cash flows \nattributable to the hedged risk. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the \nexposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ineffective portion \nof designated hedges is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The effective portion is \nrecognized in Other Comprehensive Income. \nWhen hedge accounting is applied: \n\uf0b7 \nfor fair value hedges of recognised assets and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities \nattributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss and compensate for the \neffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives \n\uf0b7 \nfor cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly \nin equity and the ineffective portion is taken to the statement of profit and loss. If the cash flow hedge of a firm \ncommitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the \ntime the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been \nrecognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not \nresult in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the \nstatement of profit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item affects the statement of profit and \nloss. \nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the \nstatement of profit and loss as and when they arise. \nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no \nlonger qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument \nrecognized in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer \n",

Joint control is contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement \nwhich exists only when decisions about the relevant activity require unanimous consent of the parties sharing \ncontrol. Investment in joint ventures are carried at cost less accumulated impairment, if any. Where an indication \nof impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its \nrecoverable amount. On disposal of investments in joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and \nthe carrying amounts are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \nAn associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence. Investment in associates are carried at \nfair value through Profit & Loss. \nT) Onerous contracts \nA provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be \nderived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the \ncontract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract \nand the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises \nany impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. \nU) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  \nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered \nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. \nThey are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as \ndeferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and contractual rights under insurance \ncontracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement. \nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair \nvalue less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset \n(or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not \npreviously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date \nof de-recognition. \nNon-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they \nare classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified \nas held for sale continue to be recognised. \nNon-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are \npresented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held \nfor sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet. \nA discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and \nthat represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated \nplan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view \nto resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit and loss. \n",

The \ncost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities \nassumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on which control is acquired. \nGoodwill arising on business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the \nconsideration transferred and the amount recognised for noncontrolling interests, and any previous interest held, \nover the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

For this purpose, the Company follows a\n\u201csimplified approach\u201d for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine\nimpairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables\nand is adjusted for forwardlooking estimates. Further, need for incremental provisions have been evaluated on a case to case basis considering forward-looking information based\non the financial health of a customer if available, litigations/disputes etc.\n",

As such, the Company operates in single business and geographical segment and\nhence disclosing information as per requirements of Ind AS 108 \"Operating Segments\" is not required.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Company assesses such claims and assertions and monitors the\nlegal environment on an ongoing basis with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a\npotential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its financial statements if material. For potential losses that are considered\npossible, but not probable, the Company provides disclosure in the financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.\ni) Matters with Income Tax Authorities include demand from tax authorities. The Company has preferred appeal on these matters and the same are pending with\nvarious appellate authorities.\nii) The Company and Zhejiang Sanmei Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (\u201cSanmei\" / \"Supplier\"), a Chinese firm, have had multiple contracts in the past for supplying gases.\nIn the fiscal year 2021, the Company entered into additional contracts with Sanmei, for the supply of various refrigerants, including R410a, R32, and R407C, to be filled\nand delivered in returnable ISO-Tanks.\nHowever, there's was a dispute between the company and Sanmei. Therefore, legal representatives of Sanmei escalated the issue by sending a demand notice on\nDecember 02, 2021, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, demanding $12,51,290.00 (equivalent to INR 1,048.44 Lakhs revalued using exchange rate\nprevailing as at September 30, 2024) for the disputed amount allegedly owned by the Company.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management has re-evaluated contingent liability related Sanmei claim previously disclosed. In accordance with Ind AS 37\nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets, a provision has been recognized for disputed trade payables due to an ongoing dispute with a supplier\nregarding outstanding payments for goods purchased in prior years. This provision represents the estimated outflow of resources that may be required to settle the\nliability, which is probable and can be reliably estimated based on the best available information.\niii) The Company has been sanctioned non-fund based Performance Bank Gaurantee limit of INR 225 lakhs. The said facility is 100% secured against term deposit of Mr.\nShazad Rustomji. Above outstanding bank gaurantees are performance bank guarantees issued by Central Bank of India to customs against the import transactions\ncarried out by the company.\nThis provision, grouped under Provision on the Balance Sheet, is distinct from trade payables and is classified as Provisions for Disputed Trade Payables. A potential\nliability adjustment or reversal may be required based on future developments in the dispute.\nGiven the ongoing nature of the dispute, the settlement amount is subject to change based on future developments and reassessment of the facts. Management will\ncontinue to evaluate the provision periodically, making adjustments as new information becomes available. If circumstances lead to a resolution in favor of the\nCompany - whether through mutual agreement, a binding court or regulatory order, or any other event confirming the liability is not payable - the provision may be\nrevisited and reversed where appropriate, in accordance with applicable Indian Accounting Standards. Such adjustments will be disclosed in the financial statements\nfor the relevant reporting period.\niv) The Company's bill discounting facility is used with recourse. To the best of knowledge of the management, there are no events occurring after the Balance sheet date\nthat provide additional information materially affecting the determination of the amount relating to the conditions existing at the Balance Sheet date that requires\nadjustment to the Assets or Liabilities of the Company.\n",

Fair values are\ndetermined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the\nsame instrument nor they are based on available market data.\na) Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market -\nThis level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This\ncategory consists of investment in quoted equity shares.\nb) Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs -\nThis level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than the quoted prices included within level 1 that are observables for the\nasset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). This level of hierarchy includes Company\u2019s derivative contracts.\n",

Management monitors the movement in foreign currency and the Company\u2019s exposure in each of the foreign currency. Based on the\nanalysis and study of movement in foreign currency, the Company takes remidial measures to hedge foreign currency risk through various measures like derivative\ninstruments etc.\nMarket risk:\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument.\nThe value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other\nmarket changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n(i) create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate fluctuations on the Company\u2019s business plan.\n(ii) achieve greater predictability to earnings by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.\nThe Company\u2019s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support\nCompany's operations. The Company\u2019s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its\noperations.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company\u2019s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Company\u2019s\nfinancial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company\u2019s\npolicies and risk objectives. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks. The risk management framework aims to:\niii) There have been no transfers between Level 1, level 2 and Level 3 for the period ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended March 31, 2024, March 31, 2023, and\nMarch 31, 2022.\nii) Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.\nTherefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could have\nrealised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, fair value of financial instruments subsequent to the reporting dates may be different from the\namounts reported at each reporting date.\ni) The Company has assessed that cash and bank balances, trade receivables, trade payables, and other financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts\nlargely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n",

The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and\nensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company has obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks. The\nCompany invests its surplus funds in bank fixed deposits, which carry no or low market risk. The Company\u2019s liquidity position remains strong at:\nINR 1,818.61 lacs as at September 30, 2024\nINR 1,707.02 lacs as at March 31, 2024\nINR 1,529.17 lacs as at March 31, 2023\nINR 176.54 lacs as at March 31, 2022\ncomprising of cash and cash equivalents and other balances with banks\nThe credit risk on bank balances and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk\nof default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks. Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally\nconsist of Cash & bank balances, trade receivables, finance receivables and loans and advances. Company regularly reviews the credit limits of the customers and takes\naction to reduce the risk. Further diverse and large customer bases also reduces the risk. All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on quarterly basis.\nMarket risk - Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cashflow of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of\nchange in market interest rate. The company does not have any borrowings, hence there is no exposure to interest rate risk.\n",

If any such indication exists, the \nassets recoverable amounts are estimated at each reporting date. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less \ncosts to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their \npresent value using a pre-discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the \nrisks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together \ninto the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the \ncash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the \u201ccash-generating unit\u201d). An impairment loss is recognised \nwhenever the carrying amount of an asset or the cash generating unit exceeds the corresponding recoverable amount. \nImpairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n \nImpairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has \ndecreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to \ndetermine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount \ndoes not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation, if no \nimpairment loss had been recognised. Impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period \nunless the impairment loss was caused by a specific external event of an exceptional nature that is not expected to \nrecur, and subsequent external events have occurred that reverse the effect of that event. \n \nJ) Borrowing costs \n \nBorrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are treated as \ndirect cost and are considered as part of cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily requires a \nsubstantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended in \nthe period during which the active development is delayed beyond reasonable time due to other than temporary \ninterruption. All other borrowing costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss as incurred. \n \nK) Inventories \n \nInventories of raw materials, components and stores and spare parts are valued at lower of cost and net realisable \nvalue. Cost includes purchase price, duties and taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the Company from \ntaxing authorities), freight inward and other expenditure in bringing inventories to present locations and conditions. \nIn determining the cost, First-in-First-out (FIFO) method is used. The carrying costs of raw materials, components \nand stores and spare parts are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated \nare expected to be sold at or above cost. \n \nFinished goods are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The comparison of cost and net realisable \nvalue is made on an item by item basis. Cost comprises of direct material and labour expenses and an appropriate \nportion of production overheads incurred in bringing the inventory to their present location and condition. Fixed \n",

The contract conveys the right to control the use of \nan identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and the Company has substantially all of the economic \nbenefits from use of the asset and has right to direct the use of the identified asset. The cost of the right-of-use asset \nshall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at \nor before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently \nmeasured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any \nremeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the \ncommencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. \n \nThe Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the \ncommencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that \nrate can be readily determined. \n \nIf that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For short-term and low value \nleases, the Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm. When the lease liability is remeasured due to change in contract terms, a corresponding change is made to the \ncarrying amount of right-of-use asset, or is recorded in the profit and loss account if the carrying amount of right-of-\nuse asset is reduced to zero. \n \nLease under which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance \nlease. Such assets acquired are capitalised at fair value of the asset or present value of the minimum lease payments \nat the inception of the lease, whichever is lower. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of \nownership are not transferred to the Company as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under \noperating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis \nover the period of the lease unless the payments are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to \ncompensate for the lessor\u2019s expected inflationary cost increases. \n \nCompany as lessor \n \nIn respect of assets given on operating lease, the lease rental income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss \non a straight-line basis over the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase in line with expected general \ninflation to compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. \n \nM) Employee benefits \n \nThe Company\u2019s obligation towards various employee benefits have been recognized as follows: \n \nShort term benefits \n \nEmployee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employees services are classified as short-term \nemployee benefits. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus and exgratia.

Re-measurement gains and losses of the net defined benefit liability/ (asset) are recognized \nimmediately in other comprehensive income. Such re-measurements are not re-classified to the Statement of Profit & \nLoss in the subsequent period. The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/ (asset) is treated \nas a net expense within employment costs. \n \nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related \nrestructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised, whichever is earlier. \n \nThe defined benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined-benefit \nobligation as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. \n \nOther long-term employee benefits \n \nCompensated absences \n \nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits such as annual leave and sick leave are measured \nat the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Company in respect of services \nprovided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuation being \ncarried out at each year end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and \nchanges in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they \narise. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in \nwhich the employee renders the related service are recognized based on actuarial valuation. \n \nTermination Benefits \n \nTermination Benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement benefits or Termination Benefits arising from restructuring, \nare recognized in the Statement of Profit & Loss. The Company recognizes Termination Benefits at the earlier of the \nfollowing dates: \n \n(a) when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of these benefits, or \n(b) when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of Ind AS 37 and involves the \npayment of termination benefits. \n \nBenefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value. \n \nEmployee Stock Option Plans \n \n",

The fair value as on grant date factoring \nsuch time and performance conditions is recognized as employee benefit expense over the vesting \nperiod of such options \n \nN) Foreign exchange transactions \n \nForeign exchange transactions are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transactions. Year-end \nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year-end foreign exchange rates. \nNon- Monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \nexchange rate at the date of transaction. Non-monetary items, measured at fair value denominated in a foreign currency \nare translated using the exchange rates that existed when the fair value was determined. \n \nExchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit \nand Loss. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with \nthe recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose \nfair value gain or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) or profit and loss are also recognised in \nOCI or profit and loss, respectively). \n \nO) Provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets \n \nA provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that \nprobably requires an outflow of resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the \neffect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to reflect its present value using a current pre-\ntax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. \n \nWhen discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost. \nEach provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance \nsheet date. \n \nContingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which \nwill be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within \nthe control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an \noutflow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. When there is a \npossible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no \nprovision or disclosure is made.  \n \nContingent assets are generally not recognized but are disclosed when inflow of economic benefit is probable. \nProvisions, Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date. \n \nP) Income taxes \n \nTax expense for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit \nfor the year. \n \nTaxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of profit and loss because it excludes items of income \nor expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or \ndeductible. The Company\u2019s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted \nor substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. \n \nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying values of assets and \nliabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is \naccounted for using liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary \ndifferences. In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable \nprofits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. \n \n",

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow \nfrom the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to cover or settle the carrying value \nof its assets and liabilities. \n \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and \nthere are legally enforceable rights to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction and \nthere is an intention to settle the asset & liability on a net basis. \n \nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the statement of profit and loss, except when they \nrelate to items credited or debited either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is also \nrecognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. \n \nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is \nlikely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability.

For the purpose of \ncalculating diluted earnings per share, net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company \nand the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effect of all dilutive \npotential equity shares. \n \nR) Financial Instruments \n \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity \ninstrument of another entity. \n \nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. \n \nTransaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities \n(other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss) are added to or deducted from \nthe fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.

Financial assets measured at fair value \n \nFair Value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) \n \nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held \nwithin a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows or to sell \nthese financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are \nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. \n \nFinancial assets included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair \nvalue. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, \nimpairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition \nof the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. \nInterest earned while holding a FVTOCI instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate \nmethod. \n \nThe Company in respect of equity investments (other than in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures) which are not \nheld for trading has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the \nfair value of such equity instruments.

If \nthe Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control \nthe transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts \nit may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial \nasset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralised borrowing for the \nproceeds received. On de-recognition of a Financial Asset (except for Financial Assets measured at FVTOCI), the \ndifference between the carrying amount and the consideration received is recognized in the Statement of Profit & \nLoss. \n \n(b) Financial liabilities and equity instruments \nClassification as debt or equity financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified \naccording to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and \nan equity instrument. \n \nEquity instruments \n \nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all \nof its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  \n \nFinancial Liabilities \n \nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured \nat amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method where the time value of money is significant. Interest bearing \nbank loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised \ncost using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the \nsettlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in the statement of profit and \nloss. \n \nDe-recognition of financial liabilities \n \nThe Company de-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company\u2019s obligations are discharged, \ncancelled or they expire. The differences between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the \nconsideration paid is recognized in the Statement of Profit & Loss. \n \nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting \n \nThe Company enters into forward contracts and principal and interest swap contracts to hedge its risks associated with \nforeign currency and variable interest rate fluctuations related to existing financial assets and liabilities, certain firm \ncommitments and forecasted transactions. These derivative contracts are being considered as cash flow hedge. \n \nThe use of hedging instruments is governed by the Company\u2019s policies approved by the Board of Directors. The \nCompany does not use these contracts for trading or speculative purposes. \n \nTo designate a forward contract/ swap contract as an effective hedge, management objectively evaluates and evidences \nwith appropriate supporting documents at the inception of each contract whether the contract is effective in offsetting \ncash flows attributable to the hedged risk. \n \nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value from the date the derivative contract is entered into \nand are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. \n \nThe Company adopts hedge accounting for forward and interest rate contracts wherever possible.

The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged \nis assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ineffective portion of designated hedges is \nrecognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The effective portion is recognized in Other \nComprehensive Income. \n \nWhen hedge accounting is applied: \n \n\uf0b7 \nfor fair value hedges of recognised assets and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities \nattributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss and compensate for the \neffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives \n\uf0b7 \nfor cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly \nin equity and the ineffective portion is taken to the statement of profit and loss. If the cash flow hedge of a firm \ncommitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the \ntime the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been \nrecognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result \nin the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the statement \nof profit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item affects the statement of profit and loss. \n \nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the statement \nof profit and loss as and when they arise. \n \nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no \nlonger qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized \nin equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to \noccur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the statement of profit and loss for the \nperiod. \n \nS) Investment in Joint Ventures & associates \n \nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties have the joint control of the arrangement and have rights to \nthe net assets to joint arrangement. Joint control is contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement which \nexists only when decisions about the relevant activity require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. \nInvestment in joint ventures are carried at cost less accumulated impairment, if any. Where an indication of impairment \nexists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On \ndisposal of investments in joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are \nrecognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n \nAn associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence. Investment in associates are carried at fair \nvalue through Profit & Loss. \n \nT) Onerous contracts \n \nA provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be \nderived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the \ncontract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract \nand the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises \nany impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. \n \nU) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  \n \nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered \nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. \nThey are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as \ndeferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and contractual rights under insurance \ncontracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement. \n",

Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as \nwell as concentration risks. Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist \nof Cash & bank balances, trade receivables, finance receivables and loans and advances. Company regularly reviews \nthe credit limits of the customers and takes action to reduce the risk. Further diverse and large customer bases also \nreduces the risk. All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on quarterly basis. The credit risk on bank \nbalances and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings. \n \nLiquidity Risk:  \n \nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk \nmanagement is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.
