The Offer Price, market capitalization to total revenue multiple and price to earnings ratio based on the Offer Price of our \nCompany, may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares on listing. \n2. We depend on the success of our relationships with our customers. We generally do business with customers on purchase \norder basis and do not enter into long term contracts with our customers.

We do not enter into long-term agreements with suppliers for our raw materials and we are also dependent on the imported \nraw materials. An increase in the cost of, or a shortfall in the availability or quality of such raw materials, in a timely \nmanner or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations. \n4. Our business is dependent on our facilities and we are subject to certain risks in our manufacturing processes. Any \nunscheduled, unplanned or prolonged disruption of our manufacturing operations could materially and adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. \n5. We are required to obtain, renew or maintain statutory and regulatory permits, licenses and approvals to operate our \nbusiness and our facilities, and any delay or inability in obtaining, renewing or maintaining such permits, licenses and \napprovals could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n6. We intend to set up a new facility in Udaipur (District), Rajasthan, and such expansion will be subject to the risks of \nunanticipated delays in implementation and cost overruns. \n7. We are subject to quality requirements, regular inspections and audits, and sales of our products is dependent on our quality \ncontrols and standards. Any failure to comply with quality standards may adversely affect our business prospects, cash \nflows and financial performance, including cancellation of existing and future orders. \n8. Restrictions on import of raw materials, sustained increase in the cost of resin and an increase in shipment cost may \nadversely impact our business, cash flows and results of operations. \n",

These forward-looking statements include statements as to our business \nstrategy, plans, revenue and profitability (including, without limitation, any financial or operating projections or forecasts) and \nother matters discussed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus that are not historical facts. However, these are not the exclusive \nmeans of identifying forward-looking statements. \nThese forward-looking statements are based on our current plans, estimates, presumptions and expectations and actual results \nmay differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to \nrisks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the \nrelevant forward-looking statement. This may be due to risks or uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, \nbut not limited to, regulatory changes pertaining to the industries we cater to and our ability to respond to them, our ability to \nsuccessfully implement our strategies, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general \neconomic and political conditions in India and globally, which have an impact on our business activities or investments, the \nmonetary and fiscal policies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, \nequity prices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in domestic laws, \nregulations and taxes, changes in competition in our industry and incidence of any natural calamities and/or acts of violence. \nCertain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited \nto, the following:  \n1. The Offer Price, market capitalization to total revenue multiple and price to earnings ratio based on the Offer Price of our \nCompany, may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares on listing. \n2. We depend on the success of our relationships with our customers. We generally do business with customers on purchase \norder basis and do not enter into long term contracts with our customers. Any loss of one or more of our top customers, or \nthe deterioration of their financial condition or prospects, or a reduction in their demand for our products, could adversely \naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n3. We do not enter into long-term agreements with suppliers for our raw materials and we are also dependent on the imported \nraw materials. An increase in the cost of, or a shortfall in the availability or quality of such raw materials, in a timely \nmanner or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations. \n4. Our business is dependent on our facilities and we are subject to certain risks in our manufacturing processes.

We intend to set up a new facility in Udaipur (District), Rajasthan, and such expansion will be subject to the risks of \nunanticipated delays in implementation and cost overruns. \n7. We are subject to quality requirements, regular inspections and audits, and sales of our products is dependent on our quality \ncontrols and standards. Any failure to comply with quality standards may adversely affect our business prospects, cash \nflows and financial performance, including cancellation of existing and future orders. \n8. Restrictions on import of raw materials, sustained increase in the cost of resin and an increase in shipment cost may \nadversely impact our business, cash flows and results of operations. \n9. We may not be successful in penetrating new export markets. If we are unable to grow in our existing export markets or \nare unsuccessful in penetrating new markets, may adversely affect our business prospects, cash flows and financial \nperformance, including cancellation of existing and future orders \n10. There have been certain instances of delays in payment of statutory dues by us in the past.

If we are unable to \ncollect customer receivables or if the provisions for doubtful receivables are inadequate, it could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. \nWhile we have generally not had any delays or defaults by our customers, there have been some instances of delays \nor settlements with our customers. For instance, in Fiscal 2024, one of our customers delayed a payment and \nsubsequently our Company engaged with the customer and consented to a settlement, and in Fiscal 2025 we agreed to \nreduce their payment obligation by \u20b9 3.27 million. Any defaults or delays in payments by any customer or the \ninsolvency or financial distress of any customer may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain historic levels of business from our \nsignificant customers, or that we will be able to significantly reduce customer concentration in the future. \nIn addition, although we receive repeat orders from customers, we do not enter into long-term contracts with our \ncustomers and have no exclusivity arrangement with any of them. In the absence of long-term contracts, there can be \nno assurance that our existing customers will continue to purchase our products. Cancellation by customers or delay \nor reduction in their orders or instances where anticipated orders fail to materialize can result in mismatch between \nour inventories of raw materials and of manufactured products, thereby increasing our inventory costs, which may \nadversely affect our profitability and liquidity. While there have been no such instances in the last three Fiscals wherein \nthe customers cancelled their orders, we cannot assure you that such events may not happen in future. In addition, we \nmay not find any customers or purchasers for the surplus or excess products manufactured, in which case we would \nbe forced to incur a loss. Our inability to find customers for surplus products may result in excessive inventories which \nmay become obsolete and may be required to be written off in the future. \nOur relationships with our customers are therefore dependent to a large extent on our ability to regularly meet customer \nrequirements, including price competitiveness, efficient and timely product deliveries and consistent product quality. \nIn the event we are unable to meet such requirements in the future, it may result in decrease in orders or cessation of \nbusiness from affected customers. \n3. \nWe do not enter into long-term agreements with suppliers for our raw materials and we are also dependent on the \nimported raw materials. An increase in the cost of, or a shortfall in the availability or quality of such raw materials, \nin a timely manner or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations. \nOur competitiveness, manufacturing costs, and profitability depend, in part, on our ability to source and maintain a \nstable and sufficient supply of raw materials. We currently have multiple suppliers for each of our raw materials and \nwhile we do not enter into long-term supply contracts, we have not experienced any disruptions in our supplies. \nFurther, with most of our raw material suppliers, we source raw materials from suppliers on a purchase order basis \nwhere the pricing is typically negotiated for each purchase order on the basis of several factors including the prevailing \nprices of such raw materials in international markets. The absence of long-term contracts at fixed prices exposes us to \nvolatility in the prices of raw materials that we require and while we typically pass on these costs to our customers, in \nthe event we are unable to do so, it may impact our results of operations.

There can be no assurance that, in \nthe event of an increase in our raw material requirements, or any decrease in availability of such raw materials with \nour suppliers, we may not be able to procure adequate raw materials in a timely manner. In addition, the price and \navailability of such raw materials depend on various factors beyond our control, including overall economic conditions, \nforeign exchange rates, production levels, market demand and competition for such materials, production and \ntransportation costs, duties and taxes and trade and regulatory restrictions. In addition, there can be no assurance that \nwe will be able to enter into new or continue our existing arrangements with our raw materials suppliers on terms \ncommercially acceptable to us, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to source raw materials in a \ncommercially viable and timely manner, if at all, which may impact our business operations and financial performance. \n4. \nOur business is dependent on our facilities and we are subject to certain risks in our manufacturing processes. Any \nunscheduled, unplanned or prolonged disruption of our manufacturing operations could materially and adversely \naffect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. \nAs on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have four facilities located in Udaipur, Rajasthan. For details, \nrefer to \u201cOur Business \u2013 Facilities\u201d on page 181. Of these, we utilise two of our facilities for manufacturing which \nhave fungible capacities that can cater to our product range. Our business is dependent on our ability to efficiently \nmanage our facilities and operations and the operational risks associated with it, including those beyond our reasonable \ncontrol. Any unscheduled, unplanned or prolonged disruption of our manufacturing operations, including on account \nof power failure, fire, mechanical failure of equipment, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, \nobsolescence, non-availability of adequate labour or disagreements with our workforce, lock-outs, earthquakes and \nother natural disasters, industrial accidents, any significant social, political or economic disturbances or infectious \ndisease outbreaks, could reduce our ability to meet the conditions of our contracts and adversely affect sales and \nrevenues from operations in such fiscal period. Disruptions in our manufacturing operations could delay production \nor require us to temporarily or permanently cease operations at our facilities and require us to incur additional \nexpenditure to attempt to mitigate such disruption.  \nIf any industrial accident, loss of human life or environmental damage were to occur we could be subject to significant \npenalties, other actionable claims and, in some instances, criminal prosecution.

We believe establishing a presence in such international markets would \nfacilitate our sales, marketing and business development activities and provide us with timely insights into the \neconomic, product requirements and regulatory environment in such markets. The risks involved in entering new \ngeographic markets and expanding operations, may be higher than expected, and we may face significant competition \nin such markets. In the eventuality we are unable to successfully expand into new geographical regions, our growth \nplans and future performance shall be adversely affected. By expanding into new geographical regions, we could be \nsubject to additional risks associated with establishing and conducting operations, including compliance with a wide \nrange of laws, regulations and practices; exposure to expropriation or other government actions; and political, \neconomic and social instability. \n10. \nThere have been certain instances of delays in payment of statutory dues by us in the past. Any delay in payment of \nstatutory dues by us in the future, may result in the imposition of penalties and in turn may have an adverse effect \non our Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. \n",

The price and \navailability of resins are subject to volatility due to factors beyond our control, including changes in crude oil prices, \nsupply chain disruptions, geopolitical events, and natural disasters. Any sustained increase in resin prices could \nsubstantially raise our production costs. \nAdditionally, the resin market may experience shortages or supply constraints due to increased global demand, \nproduction capacity limitations, or regulatory restrictions on resin production. If we are unable to secure an adequate \nsupply of resins at favourable prices, or if our suppliers fail to deliver on time, our manufacturing processes could be \ndisrupted, leading to delays in fulfilling customer orders. Furthermore, our ability to pass on increased resin costs to \nour customers may be limited by competitive pressures and contractual obligations. If we are unable to adjust our \npricing to reflect rising raw material costs, our profit margins may be squeezed, adversely affecting our financial \nperformance. These factors combined could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, \nand cash flows. \n12. \nWe are unable to trace some of our historical corporate records including in relation to certain allotments made by \nour Company. We cannot assure you that no legal proceedings or regulatory actions will be initiated against our \nCompany in the future in relation to these matters, which may impact our financial condition and reputation. \nFurther, we have filed a compounding application with the RoC, which is pending as of this Draft Red Herring \nProspectus. \nOur Company has not been able to trace certain corporate records such as form filings for the allotments made on \nDecember 9, 2002, March 29, 2003 and March 31, 2005.

If there is any \ndecline in the demand for our customer\u2019s products, our revenue from operations, cash flows and profitability could \nbe adversely affected. \nOur products are used across various residential, industrial and commercial projects, and have a variety of end-uses \nincluding mouldings, wall panels, door and frames, ceilings, signages, counter top display and QR Code displays. \n(Source: Wazir Report). For further information, see \u201cOur Business\u201d on page 161. In the event of quality issues in our \ncustomers\u2019 products that can ultimately be attributed to our products, we may face a number of consequences, \nincluding, lower demand for, and decreased sales of, the relevant products, leading to inventory write-offs, potential \nrecall or withdrawal of the relevant products; withdrawal or cancellation of regulatory approvals for our facilities; \ndamage to our reputation and brand name; and exposure to lawsuits and regulatory investigation relating to the relevant \nproducts that result in liabilities, fines or sanctions. There can be no assurance that our products will at all times comply \nwith customer specifications, and the rejection of a large volume of products could adversely affect our operations. In \nthe past three fiscals, the sales returned by our customers was \u20b9 6.54 million, \u20b9 0.50 million and \u20b9 0.95 million for \nFiscals 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nOur commercial success also depends to a large extent on the success of our customers\u2019 products with end consumers \nand downturns or industry cycles that impact demand. The success of the end products manufactured by our customers \ndepends on our customers\u2019 ability to identify early on, and correctly assess consumer market preferences. We cannot \nassure you that our customers will correctly assess consumer preferences in a timely manner or that demand for goods \nin which our products are used will not decline. If the demand for our customers\u2019 products in which our products are \nused declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n15. \nWe are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and standards. Non-\ncompliance with and adverse changes in health, safety, labour, and environmental laws and other similar \nregulations to our manufacturing operations may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows \nand financial condition.  \nWe are subject to a wide range of laws and government regulations, including in relation to safety, health, labour, and \nenvironmental protection including the Factories Act, 1948, Environmental Protection Act, 1986, as amended, the Air \nPrevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981, the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974 Water \n(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. These safety, health, labour, and environmental protection laws \nand regulations impose controls on air and water release or discharge, noise levels, disposal of hazardous materials. \nFor instance, there is a limit on the amount of pollutant discharge that our facilities may release into the air and water. \nEnvironmental laws and regulations in India have become and continue to be more stringent, and the scope and extent \nof new environmental regulations, including their effect on our operations, cannot be predicted with any certainty. In \ncase of any change in environmental or pollution regulations, we may be required to invest in, among other things, \nenvironmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and emissions management and other expenditure to comply \nwith environmental standards. Any failure on our part to comply with any existing or future regulations applicable to \nus may result in legal proceedings, including public interest litigation being commenced against us, third party claims \nor the levy of regulatory fines. Further, any violation of the environmental laws and regulations may result in fines, \ncriminal sanctions, revocation of operating permits, or shutdown of our facilities. The occurrence of any of these events \ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  \nAs a consequence of unanticipated regulatory or other developments, future environmental and regulatory related \nexpenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated. We cannot assure you that our costs of \ncomplying with current and future environmental laws and other regulations will not adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations or financial condition. In addition, we could incur substantial costs, our products could be \nrestricted from entering certain markets, and we could face other sanctions, if we were to violate or become liable \nunder environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with applicable regulations. Our potential exposure \nincludes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. \nThe amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.  \nWe are also subject to the laws and regulations governing employees in such areas as minimum wage and maximum \nworking hours, overtime, working conditions, hiring and termination of employees, and work permits.

If our research and development \nefforts do not succeed, the introduction of new products may be hindered, which could adversely affect our business, \ncash flows, growth and financial condition.  \nOur success depends significantly on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products in a timely \nmanner. The development and commercialization process are both time consuming and costly, and involves a high \ndegree of business risk. During these periods, our competitors may be developing similar products of which we are \nunaware of that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development. Due to the prolonged period \nof time for developing a new product, we may invest resources in developing products that will face competition of \nwhich we are currently unaware. Such unforeseen competition may hinder our ability to effectively plan the timing of \nour product development, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of \noperations. Our future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully develop new \nproducts and continue our product portfolio expansion in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition, our business \nis also dependent on our R&D capabilities to assist our customers on their projects including development of their \nproducts. The development and commercialisation of new products (whether ours or our customers\u2019 products) are \ncomplex, time-consuming, costly and involves a high degree of business risk. While there have been no instances in \nthe past three Fiscals where our R&D efforts did not yield to the desired results, we cannot assure you that our future \nor existing R&D efforts may successfully create new products or that we may not encounter unexpected delays in the \nlaunch of these products and even if launched as planned, such products may not perform as we expect. The success \nof our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to properly anticipate customer \nneeds; establish collaborations with suppliers and customers; develop and manufacture our products in a timely and \ncost-effective manner through our R&D efforts; and successfully market and sell our products.  \nOur products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as we expect, \nand we may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market such products. Even if we are successful in \ndeveloping a new product, such product may become subject to litigation by other parties claiming that our product \ninfringes on their patents or may be otherwise unsuccessful in the market place due to the introduction of superior \nproducts by our competitors.  \nIn addition, the development and commercialisation of new products is characterised by significant upfront costs, \nincluding costs associated with R&D, product development activities, building inventory and sales and marketing. To \ndevelop our product pipeline, we commit substantial time, efforts, funds and other resources for R&D in areas which \nwe believe have significant growth potential. Our R&D operations are focused on developing new products as well as \nimproving the efficiency of our existing products.  \nOur future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully develop new products \nand continue our product portfolio expansion in a timely and cost-effective manner. While there have been no instances \nof failure of product success in the last three Fiscals, we cannot assure you that all the products that we develop will \nbe successful which may impact our financial condition, revenue from operations and our cash flows.  \n17. \nOur funding requirements and proposed deployment of the Net Proceeds are based on management estimates and \nmay be subject to change based on various factors, some of which are beyond our control.  \nWe intend to use the Net Proceeds for the purposes described in \u201cObjects of the Offer\u201d on page 89. As on the date of \nthis Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our funding requirements are based on management estimates in view of past \nexpenditures, and have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution. Our funding requirements and proposed \ndeployment of the Net Proceeds are based on current conditions and are subject to change in light of changes in external \ncircumstances, costs, business initiatives, other financial conditions or business strategies.

In the event of any such circumstances that require us to undertake variation in the disclosed utilization of \nthe Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the shareholders\u2019 approval in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or \ninability in obtaining such shareholders\u2019 approval may adversely affect our business or operations. \nFurther, our Promoters would be required to provide an exit opportunity to Shareholders who do not agree with our \nproposal to change the objects of the Offer or vary the terms of such contracts, at a price and manner as prescribed by \nSEBI. Additionally, the requirement on Promoters to provide an exit opportunity to such dissenting shareholders may \ndeter the Promoters from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds, even if such variation \nis in the interest of our Company. Further, we cannot assure you that the Promoters or the controlling shareholders of \nour Company will always have adequate resources at their disposal to enable them to provide an exit opportunity at \nthe price prescribed by SEBI. \nIn light of these factors, we may not be able to undertake variation of objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds \nof the Offer, if any, or vary the terms of any contract referred to in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, even if such \nvariation is in the interest of our Company. This may restrict our Company\u2019s ability to respond to any change in our \nbusiness or financial condition by re-deploying the unutilized portion of Net Proceeds, if any, or varying the terms of \ncontract, which may adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations. \n19. \nAny adverse changes in regulations governing our business operations or products or the products of our end-\ncustomers, may adversely impact our business, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. \nGovernment regulations and policies of India as well as our exports markets can affect the demand for, expenses \nrelated to and availability of our products. We have incurred and expect to continue incurring costs for compliance \nwith such laws and regulations. Any changes in government regulations and policies, such as the withdrawal of or \nchanges in tax benefits, incentives and subsidies or anti-dumping duties levied by India or other countries, could \nadversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations. Further, regulatory requirements with respect to \nour products and the products of our customers are subject to change.

For further information, see \u201cOur Business \u2013 Strategies\u201d on page 172. Our ability to achieve our growth \nstrategies will be subject to a range of factors, including our ability to identify market opportunities and demands in \nthe industry, develop products using our technologies and our ability to continue to research develop products, compete \nwith existing companies in our markets, consistently exercise effective quality control, hire and train qualified \npersonnel and undertake complex chemistries. Many of these factors are beyond our control and there is no assurance \nthat we will succeed in implementing our strategies. We may face increased risks when we enter new markets in India \nand internationally, and may find it more difficult to hire, train and retain qualified employees in new regions. In \naddition, we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers with adequate supplies of raw materials meeting our \nquality standards.  \nOur business growth could strain our managerial, operational and financial resources. Our ability to manage future \ngrowth will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management \ninformation systems on a timely basis and to expand, train, motivate and manage our workforce. There can be no \nassurance that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future growth. Failure \nto effectively manage our expansion may lead to increased costs and reduced profitability and may adversely affect \nour growth prospects. While there have been no instances of failure of in the last three Fiscals, our inability to manage \nour business and implement our growth strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, cash flows and profitability. \n21. \nUnder-utilization of our manufacturing capacities and an inability to effectively utilize our expanded \nmanufacturing capacities could have an adverse effect on our business, future prospects, future cash flows and \nfuture financial performance. \nAs on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we operate four facilities including two manufacturing facilities. \nIn particular, the level of our capacity utilization can impact our operating results. Our product mix also affects capacity \nutilization of our facilities, and the demand and supply balance and the average selling prices of our products, would \nin turn affect our gross profit margin.  \nOur capacity utilization is affected by the availability of raw materials, industry/ market conditions as well as by the \nproduct requirements of, and procurement practice followed by, our customers and is subject to the thresholds \nprescribed under the consolidated consent and approval issued by the RSPCB for our facilities. In the event that we \nare unable to procure sufficient raw materials, we would not be able to achieve full capacity utilization of our facilities, \nresulting in operational inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and \nfinancial performance. \nFurther, if our customers place orders for less than anticipated volume or cancel existing orders or change their policies \nresulting in reduced quantities being supplied by us, it could result in the under-utilization of our manufacturing \ncapacities. Further, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and \naccept, production schedules, personnel requirements and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of \ncustomer orders. The changes in demand for their products could reduce our ability to estimate accurately future \ncustomer requirements, make it difficult to schedule production and lead to over production or utilization of our \nmanufacturing capacity for a particular product. Any such mismatch leading to over or under utilization of our facilities \ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For further information, \nsee \u201cOur Business \u2013 Capacity and Capacity Utilization\u201d on page 183. \n22. \nOur inability to accurately forecast demand for our products and manage our inventory or working capital balances \nmay have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n",

We conduct business with our customers \nprimarily on the basis of purchase orders that are placed from time to time. Consequently, there is no commitment on \nthe part of such customers to continue to place new purchase orders with us and as a result, our revenue and consequent \ncash flow may fluctuate significantly from time to time. The fluctuation in demand for our products may either require \nus to increase production or decrease production and inventories at short notice, which may result in us bearing \nadditional costs and incurring losses. While we maintain a reasonable level of inventory of raw materials, work in \nprogress and finished products, if we underestimate demand or have inadequate capacity due to which we are unable \nto meet the demand for our products, we may end up manufacturing lesser quantities of products than required, which \ncould result in the loss of business. At times when we have overestimated demand, we may have incurred costs to \nbuild capacity or purchased more raw materials and manufactured more products than required. Our inability to \naccurately forecast demand for our products and manage our inventory may have an adverse effect on our business, \nresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The table below sets forth details of certain parameters as of \nthe dates indicated:  \nParticulars \nAs of March 31, \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nInventory (\u20b9 million) \n403.89 \n399.07 \n739.62 \nTotal Current Assets (\u20b9 million) \n990.76 \n1,424.93 \n1,714.49 \nInventory as a percentage of Total Current Assets \n40.77% \n28.01% \n43.14% \nTotal Assets (\u20b9 million) \n1,418.57 \n1,973.76 \n2,942.94 \nTotal Current Liabilities (\u20b9 million) \n786.96 \n757.04 \n652.13 \nInventory Turnover Ratio (number of times) (1) \n4.33 \n4.48 \n2.57 \nNet Working Capital Days(2) \n95 \n60 \n30 \nNet Capital Turnover Ratio (number of times) (3) \n12.50 \n6.21 \n3.92 \n(1) \nInventory Turnover Ratio is calculated as revenue from operations less export incentives divided by average inventory for the \nyear/period. Average inventory is calculated as an average of inventory at the beginning of the year and inventory at the end \nof the year/period. \n(2) \nNet Working Capital Days is calculated as working capital requirement (being total current assets \u2013 total current liabilities) \nfor the year/period divided by revenue from operations multiplied by number of days in a year.  \n(3) \nNet Capital Turnover Ratio is calculated as calculated as revenue from operations divided by working capital requirements \n(being total current assets \u2013 total current liabilities). \nWe evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated \ndemand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product sales mix. Efficient inventory \nmanagement is a key component for the success of our business. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient \ninventory levels and an appropriate product sales mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands, without allowing those levels \nto increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely affects our \nresults of operations. If our raw materials purchase decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels, or if our \nestimation of customer requirements and trends are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or \nimpairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory, which can adversely affect our results of operations. \nOur working capital requirements may increase if payment terms shift to payments on completion of delivery or \notherwise increase our working capital burdens. In addition, our working capital requirements have increased in recent \nyears due to the general growth of our business. If a customer defaults in making its payment on a product to which \nwe have devoted significant resources, it may also affect our profitability and liquidity and decrease the capital \nresources that are otherwise available for other uses. All of these factors may result in increases in our working capital \nrequirements. If we are unable to finance our working capital needs, or secure other financing when needed, on \nacceptable commercial terms or at all, it may adversely affect our business, growth prospects and results of operations. \n23. \nOur income and sales are subject to seasonal fluctuations and lower income in a peak season may have a \ndisproportionate effect on our results of operations.  \nOur sales have historically exhibited certain seasonal fluctuations, reflecting a slight dip in sales volumes and profit \nmargins during lean season for building materials, especially in our export markets. For instance, during certain harsh \nweather conditions for construction activities, the demand for building materials in certain sections of our USA markets \nand EU markets may witness a decline. While we maintain our production levels and inventory to account for this \nseasonality, our fixed costs such as lease rentals, employee salaries, store operating costs and logistics-related \nexpenses, which form a significant portion of our operating costs, are relatively constant throughout the year.  \nConsequently, lower than expected sales during certain quarters of the fiscal year or more pronounced seasonal \nvariations in sales in the future could have a disproportionate impact on our operating results for the fiscal year or \ncould strain our resources and significantly impair our cash flows. Further, as a result of the above, our quarter-on-\nquarter financial results may not be comparable or a meaningful indicator of our futuristic performance. While we \n",

The products that we produce are \nsubject to risks such as, transportation, storage, breakage during transportation, installation, breakage due to loads \nexceeding the rated load bearing capacity of the products amongst others. If our products cause any harm to their end-\nusers, we may face a number of consequences, including, a severe decrease in the demand for, and sales of, the relevant \nproducts; the recall or withdrawal of the relevant products; damage to our reputation and brand name; and exposure to \nlawsuits and regulatory investigation relating to the relevant products that result in liabilities, fines or sanctions. We \nare also exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the use of our products results in personal injury. \nWe face the risk of loss resulting from, and the adverse publicity associated with, product liability lawsuits, whether \nor not such claims are valid.

Further, \nwhile we seek to conform our products to meet a variety of specifications and regulatory requirements, there can be \nno assurance that product liability claims or recall claims against us will not arise, whether due to product malfunctions, \ndefects, or other causes. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or the ultimate success of the defence against \nthem, are expensive. Even unsuccessful product liability claims would likely require us to incur substantial amounts \non litigation, divert our management\u2019s time, adversely affect our goodwill and impair the marketability of our products. \nFurther, there may be instances where our Company is unable to meet the timelines for delivery of the products to its \ncustomer. Any such time overrun may result in termination of the arrangement, price negotiations and reputational \nharm, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial position. Further, as on the date of this Draft \nRed Herring Prospectus, we do not have a product liability insurance policy. While we have not been subject to any \nmaterial product liability claims in the last three Fiscals, any such future claim against us will adversely affect our \neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and prospects. \n25. \nWe have incurred indebtedness and an inability to comply with repayment and other covenants in our financing \nagreements could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, certain of our financing \nagreements involve variable interest rates and an increase in interest rates may adversely affect our results of \noperations, cash flows and financial condition.  \nThe industry in which we operate is working capital intensive in nature. We have historically financed our working \ncapital requirements mainly through bank limits and internal accruals and have supplemented this with certain \narrangements with banks. The table below provides details of our total financial indebtedness in the relevant periods \nand the quantum of working capital facilities within such indebtedness: \nPeriod \nTotal Indebtedness  \n(\u20b9 million) \nWorking Capital Facilities \n(\u20b9 million) \nAs of March 31, 2024 \n300.64 \n295.81 \nAs of March 31, 2023 \n293.97 \n187.10 \nAs of March 31, 2022 \n296.03 \n166.16 \nWorking Capital Gap is defined as the difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities \nFor further information on our borrowings, see \u201cFinancial Indebtedness\u201d on page 275.  \nAs we intend to pursue a strategy of continued investment in our development activities, we will incur additional \nexpenditure in the current and future fiscal periods. We propose to fund such expenditure through a combination of \ndebt, equity and internal accruals. Our ability to borrow and the terms of our borrowings will depend on our financial \ncondition, the stability of our cash flows and our capacity to service debt in a rising interest rate environment.  \nThe actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may also differ from estimates as a result of, among \nother things, change in business plans due to prevailing economic conditions, unanticipated expenses, new \nconsumption themes or products, and regulatory changes. To the extent our planned expenditure requirements exceed \nour available resources, we will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. We may also have difficulty \naccessing capital markets, which may make it more difficult or expensive to obtain financing in the future.

These assumptions and estimates include three shifts per day operating for 24 hours a day with an \naverage 25 days working in a month including provisions for basic downtime and maintenance. While we have \nobtained a certificate dated September 26, 2024 from Priyal Kothari (bearing membership number 072535) in relation \nto such annual installed capacity of our facilities and capacity utilisation, future capacity utilisation may vary \nsignificantly from the estimated production capacities of our facilities and historical capacity utilisation. For further \ninformation, see \u201cOur Business - Capacity and Capacity Utilization\u201d on page 183. Further, the installed capacity, \ncapacity utilisation and other related information may not be computed on the basis of any standard methodology that \nis applicable across the industry and therefore may not be comparable to capacity information that may be computed \nand presented by other comparable companies in the industry in which we operate due to a variety of factors including \nproduct specifications, size and thickness of the product etc. \n30. \nWe are dependent on a number of key personnel, including our Promoters, our Key Managerial Personnel and our \nSenior Management Personnel, and the loss of or our inability to attract or retain such persons could adversely \naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  \nOur performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our Senior Management Personnel including our \nPromoters and other Key Managerial Personnel.

Competition for individuals with specialized knowledge \nand experience is intense in our industry. The loss of the services of any key personnel or our inability to recruit or \ntrain a sufficient number of experienced personnel or our inability to manage the attrition levels in different employee \ncategories may have an adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects.

If we are unable to attract and retain \nqualified personnel, our results of operations may be adversely affected. \n31. \nWhile we have the wordmark registered for (ECHON) and have applied for registration of our corporate logo as \ntrademark, any inability to protect our intellectual property from third party infringement may adversely affect our \nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations and prospects. \nAs of the date of this DRHP, our Company has registered 24 trademarks in India under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 \nand has two trademarks registered in the USA. In addition, we have applied for four trademarks in India. We also have \nregistered the domain name, https://www.echon.co/, which is renewed periodically. We do not own any patents. For \nfurther information, see \u201cOur Business \u2013 Intellectual Property\u201d on page 187.  \nOur registered trademarks in India are valid for a period of 10 years from the date of application and renewable for a \nperiod of 10 years, on expiry. For our products, we use our proprietary formulations to manufacture products which \nprovide us the flexibility to innovate product variety to enhance durability, aesthetics and environmental sustainability \nand development of unique products tailored to specific needs. Further, our proprietary formulations provide unique \nproperties to our products, such as waterproofing, fire retardancy, termite proofing, high shore strength, screw-holding \ncapacity, and surface readiness for paint. However, we do not have any patents to protect these formulations. \nAs we expand our activities, we are also exposed to the risk that other entities may pass off their products as ours by \nimitating our brand name, packaging look and attempting to create counterfeit products. Any such activities may harm \nthe reputation of our brand and sales of our products, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance. \nWe rely on protections available under Indian law, which may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use of our \nintellectual property by third parties. Furthermore, the application of laws governing intellectual property rights in \nIndia is uncertain and evolving, and could involve substantial risks to us. While the proprietary information and \ntechnical know-how associated with the R&D in relation to our business rests with our Company, however, we cannot \nassure that our business customers may not infringe such proprietary information. Notwithstanding the precautions we \ntake to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may infringe on our rights. While no such \ninstances have occurred in last three Fiscals, we cannot assure you that, in the future, we may be subjected to this \nwhich may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n32. \nWe have certain contingent liabilities as per Ind AS 37 that have been disclosed in our financial statements, which \nif they materialise, may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows.  \nThe following table below sets forth the principal components of our contingent liabilities as per Ind AS 37 \u2013 \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as of March 31, 2024:  \nParticulars \nAmount \n(\u20b9 million) \nClaims against the Company not acknowledged as debts comprise of in respect of Pending Income Tax \nDemands \n1.44 \nBank Guarantees for Performance \n5.06 \nTotal \n6.50 \nDetails of pending Income tax demand: In subsidiary Taylias Industry P Ltd. there is a demand of \u20b9 1.44 million for the AY 2023-\n24 \nDetails of Bank Guarantees: Kumar Arch Tech Limited and Taylias Industry P Ltd has given guarantee to Govt Department for \ntender, bonds etc \nIf a significant portion of these liabilities materialize, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. \n33. \nOur operations are labour intensive and may be materially adversely affected by strikes, work stoppages or \nincreased wage demands by our employees or those of our suppliers. \nOur operations are labour intensive and we are dependent on a large labour force for our manufacturing operations. \nAs of June 30, 2024, we had 184 employees, including on-roll, executive directors and contractual employees. Some \nof our employees are part of a union and the success of our operations depends on availability of labour and maintaining \ngood relationship with our workforce and the union representing them. Shortage of skilled/ unskilled personnel or \nwork stoppages caused by disagreements with employees could have an adverse effect on our business and results of \noperations. While we have not experienced any disruption in our business operations due to disputes or other problems \nwith our work force in the last three Fiscals, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such disruption \nin the future. Such disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may also divert the \nmanagement\u2019s attention and result in increased costs.  \n",

As of June 30, 2024, at a group level, we contracted 155 labour \n(calculated as per man days). Although we do not engage these labourers directly, we are responsible for any wage \npayments to be made to such labourers in the event of default by such independent contractors. While we have not \nbeen subject to any wage payments on account of default of independent contractors in the last three Fiscals, any \nrequirement to fund their wage requirements in the future may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and \nour financial condition. \nIndia has labour legislations that protects the interests of workers, including legislation that sets forth detailed \nprocedures for the establishment of unions, dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes \ncertain financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing \nrelationships with employees, in such areas as minimum wage and maximum working hours, overtime, working \nconditions, hiring and terminating of employees and work permits. The GoI has introduced (a) the Code on Wages, \n2019, as amended; (b) the Code on Social Security, 2020, as amended; (c) the Occupational Safety, Health and \nWorking Conditions Code, 2020, as amended; and (d) the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, as amended. These new \nenactments, are intended to consolidate, subsume and replace numerous existing central labour legislations. While \ncertain portions of the Code on Wages, 2019 and section 142 of the Code on Social Security, 2020, have now been \nenforced by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the remainder of these codes have not been notified and we are \nyet to determine the impact of all or some such laws on our business and operations which may restrict our ability to \ngrow our business in the future and increase our expenses. In the absence of any precedents on the subject, the \napplication of these provisions is uncertain and may or may not have an adverse impact on us. Once these enactments \nare implemented, we may be required to incur additional expenditure to achieve compliance with such enactments. \nFor further details, see \u201cKey Regulations and Policies in India\u201d on page 190. \n34. \nFailures in internal control systems could cause operational errors which may have an adverse impact on our \nprofitability, results of operations and cash flows. \nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control measures commensurate with the size \nand complexity of operations. Internal control systems comprising policies and procedures are designed to ensure \nsound management of our operations, safekeeping of our assets, optimal utilization of resources, reliability of our \nfinancial information and compliance. The systems and procedures are periodically reviewed and routinely tested and \ncover all functions and business areas. \nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining robust internal control measures that are appropriate for the size \nand complexity of our operations. Our internal control systems, which consist of well-defined policies and procedures, \nare designed to ensure efficient management, asset protection, optimal resource utilization, financial reliability, and \nregulatory compliance. While we believe that we have adequate controls, we are exposed to operational risks arising \nfrom the potential inadequacy or failure of internal processes or systems, and our actions may not be sufficient to \nguarantee effective internal controls in all circumstances. Given the size of our operations, it is possible that errors \nmay repeat or compound before they are discovered and rectified. Our management information systems and internal \ncontrol procedures that are designed to monitor our operations and overall compliance may not identify every instance \nof non-compliance or every suspicious transaction. If internal control weaknesses are identified, our actions may not \nbe sufficient to correct such internal control weakness. These factors may have an adverse effect on our reputation, \nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. There can be no assurance that deficiencies in our \ninternal controls will not arise in the future, or that we will be able to implement, and continue to maintain, adequate \nmeasures to rectify or mitigate any such deficiencies in our internal controls. Any inability on our part to adequately \ndetect, rectify or mitigate any such deficiencies in our internal controls may adversely impact our ability to accurately \nreport, or successfully manage, our financial risks, and to avoid fraud. \n35. \nOur facilities are dependent on adequate and uninterrupted supply of electricity, and fuel. Any shortage or \ndisruption in electricity, or fuel supply may lead to disruption in operations, higher operating cost and consequent \ndecline in our operating margins.  \nOur production operations require adequate supply of electricity, and fuel, the shortage or non-availability of which \nmay adversely affect our operations.

This \nknowledge base has enhanced our ability to manage our manufacturing costs and improve our product quality to \ncompete more effectively in the PVC blend-based building material industry. Our technical know-how has been \nderived from the past experience of our management team and key employees as well as our research and development \nefforts. Certain proprietary knowledge may be leaked, either inadvertently or wilfully, at various stages of the \nmanufacturing process. Certain of our employees have access to confidential product information and amongst others, \nand there can be no assurance that this information will remain confidential. Moreover, certain of our employees may \nleave us and join our various competitors. Such technical know-how cannot be protected under the Indian legal system \nby way of registration with competent authorities, and as a result, we have to rely on employee confidentiality \nundertakings, a less effective means of protection. Further, if the confidential technical information in respect of our \nproducts or business becomes available to third parties or the public, any competitive advantage we may have over \nour competitors could be harmed. If a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology, it \nmay be difficult, expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Consequently, any leakage of \nconfidential technical information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, cash flows and/or prospects. \n37. \nSome of our facilities and our Registered Office are located on land not owned by us and have been leased to us by \nthird parties.

Notwithstanding the insurance coverage that \nwe carry, we may not be fully insured against certain business risks. There are many events that could significantly \nimpact our operations, or expose us to third-party liabilities, for which we may not be adequately insured. To the extent \nthat we suffer any loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or exceeds our insurance coverage, our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our insurance coverage expires \nfrom time to time. We apply for the renewal of our insurance coverage in the normal course of our business, but we \ncannot assure you that such renewals will be granted in a timely manner, at acceptable cost, or at all. Our inability to \nmaintain adequate insurance cover in connection with our business could adversely affect our operations and \nprofitability. To the extent that we suffer loss or damage as a result of events for which we are not insured, or for which \nwe did not obtain or maintain insurance, or which is not covered by insurance, exceeds our insurance coverage or \nwhere our insurance claims are rejected, the loss would have to be borne by us and our results of operations, financial \nperformance and cash flows could be adversely affected. \nWe could face liabilities or otherwise suffer losses should any unforeseen incident such as fire, flood, and accidents \naffect our facilities or our Registered Office or Corporate Office.

Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will continue to accurately ascertain and maintain \nadequate insurance policies for losses that may be incurred in the future. For instance, in the past three fiscals we have \nraised an insurance claim for damages to our products due to damage to the container in which it was shipped, while \nthe insurance company settled our claim, we had to bear \u20b9 0.08 million. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any \ninsurance claim made by us in the future will honoured fully, in part or on time.

In addition, \nestimating amounts of such price reductions is subject to risk and uncertainties, as any price reduction is the result of \nnegotiations and other factors. Accordingly, companies like us must be able to reduce their operating costs in order to \nmaintain profitability. Such price reductions may affect our sales and profit margins. If we are unable to offset customer \nprice reductions in the future through improved operating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, sourcing \nalternatives and other cost reduction initiatives, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be \nmaterially adversely affected. Our customers also negotiate for larger discounts in price as the volume of their orders \nincreases. To maintain our profit margins, we may seek price reductions from our suppliers, improved production \nprocesses to increase manufacturing efficiency and streamlined product designs to reduce costs. There can be no \nassurance that we will be able to avoid future customer price reductions or offset the impact of any such price \nreductions through continued technology improvements, improved operational efficiencies, cost-effective sourcing \nalternatives, new manufacturing processes, cost reductions or other productivity initiatives, which may adversely affect \nour business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  \n40. \nNegative publicity against us, our suppliers, our customers or any of our or their affiliates could cause us \nreputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results \nof operations and prospects.  \nFrom time to time, we, our suppliers, our customers or any of our or their affiliates may be subject to negative publicity \nin relation to our or their business or staff, including publicity covering issues such as anti-corruption, safety and \nenvironmental protection.

As of March 31, 2024, our fund-based limits with the State Bank of India have been secured \nthrough the guarantees. The corporate and personal guarantors for instance Tirupatibalaji Build-con Private Limited, \nS M Enterprises, Shubham Taylia, Shakun Taylia, and Jitendra Kumar Taylia. While these guarantees have been \ninstrumental in securing favourable terms for our debt, they also carry risks that could impact our business and financial \ncondition. \nAny default or failure by us to repay our loans in a timely manner or at all could trigger repayment obligations on the \npart of our Promoter in respect of such loans.

Further, in the event that our Promoter revokes or terminates such guarantees, our lenders for \nsuch facilities may ask for alternate guarantees, repayment of amounts outstanding under such facilities, or even \nterminate such facilities. We may not be successful in procuring guarantees satisfactory to the lenders, and as a result \nmay need to repay outstanding amounts under such facilities or seek additional sources of capital, which could affect \nour business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the guarantees are invoked or if the \nrepayment of loan is accelerated or the lender enforces any of the restrictive covenants or exercise their options under \nthe relevant debt financing arrangement the ability of our Company to continue its business operations could be \nadversely affected, carrying our operations and use of assets may be hampered significantly and the lender may demand \nthe repayment of the entire outstanding amount and this in turn may also affect our further borrowing abilities.

ASM and GSM are imposed on securities \nof companies based on various objective criteria such as significant variations in price and volume, enhance the \nintegrity of the market and safeguard the interest of the investors, concentration of certain client accounts as a \npercentage of combined trading volume, average delivery, securities which witness abnormal price rise not \ncommensurate with financial health and fundamentals such as earnings, book value, fixed assets, net worth, price / \nearnings multiple, market capitalization etc. \nUpon listing, the trading of our Equity Shares would be subject to differing market conditions as well as other factors \nwhich may result in high volatility in price, low trading volumes, and a large concentration of client accounts as a \npercentage of combined trading volume of our Equity Shares. The occurrence of any of the abovementioned factors \nor other circumstances may trigger any of the parameters prescribed by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for placing our \nsecurities under the GSM and/or ASM framework or any other surveillance measures, which could result in significant \nrestrictions on trading of our Equity Shares being imposed by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges. These restrictions may \ninclude requiring higher margin requirements, requirement of settlement on a trade for trade basis without netting off, \nlimiting trading frequency, reduction of applicable price band, requirement of settlement on gross basis or freezing of \nprice on upper side of trading, as well as mentioning of our Equity Shares on the surveillance dashboards of the Stock \n",

The imposition of these \nrestrictions and curbs on trading may have an adverse effect on market price, trading and liquidity of our Equity Shares \nand on the reputation and conditions of our Company. \n54. \nRecent global economic conditions have been challenging and continue to affect the Indian market, which may \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. \nThe Indian economy and its securities markets are influenced by economic developments and volatility in securities \nmarkets in other countries. Investors\u2019 reactions to developments in one country may have adverse effects on the market \nprice of securities of companies located in other countries, including India. For instance, the economic downturn in \nthe U.S. and several European countries during a part of Fiscal 2008 and 2009 adversely affected market prices in the \nglobal securities markets, including India. Negative economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, or \na default on national debt, in other emerging market countries may also affect investor confidence and cause increased \nvolatility in Indian securities markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Any worldwide financial \ninstability could also have a negative impact on the Indian economy, including the movement of exchange rates and \ninterest rates in India and could then adversely affect our business, financial performance and the price of our Equity \nShares. \nAny other global economic developments or the perception that any of them could occur may continue to have an \nadverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce \nglobal market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any \nof these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have an adverse effect \non our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our equity shares. Any financial \ndisruption could have an adverse effect on our business, future financial performance, shareholders\u2019 equity and the \nprice of our Equity Shares. \n55. \nNatural or man-made disasters, fires, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and other \nevents could materially and adversely affect our business. \nNatural disasters (such as typhoons, flooding, and/or earthquakes), epidemics, pandemics such as COVID-19, and \nman-made disasters, including acts of war, terrorist attacks, and other events, many of which are beyond our control, \nmay lead to economic instability, including in India or globally, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted \nin and may continue to result in a period of sustained instability across global financial markets, induce volatility in \ncommodity prices, increase in supply chain, logistics times and costs, increase borrowing costs, cause outflow of \ncapital from emerging markets and may lead to overall slowdown in economic activity in India. Our operations may \nbe adversely affected by fires, natural disasters, and/or severe weather, which can result in damage to our property or \ninventory and generally reduce our productivity, and may require us to evacuate personnel and suspend operations. \nAny terrorist attacks or civil unrest as well as other adverse social, economic, and political events in India could have \na negative effect on us. Such incidents could also create a greater perception that investment in Indian companies \ninvolves a higher degree of risk and could have an adverse effect on our business and the price of the Equity Shares. \nA number of countries in Asia, including India, as well as countries in other parts of the world, are susceptible to \ncontagious diseases. Future outbreaks of contagious disease could adversely affect the global economy and economic \nactivity in the region. As a result, any present or future outbreak of a contagious disease could have a material adverse \neffect on our business and the trading price of the Equity Shares. \n56. \nAny downgrading of India\u2019s sovereign debt rating by an international rating agency could have a negative impact \non our business, cash flows and results of operations. \nOur borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on the credit ratings of India. Any \nadverse revisions to credit ratings for India and other jurisdictions we operate in by international rating agencies may \nadversely impact our ability to raise additional financing. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our \ngrowth on favourable terms and consequently adversely affect our business and financial performance and the price \nof the Equity Shares. \n57. \nIf there is any change in laws or regulations, including taxation laws, or their interpretation, such changes may \nsignificantly affect our financial statements, results of operations and cash flows. \nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is evolving and is subject to change.

Accordingly, any adverse regulatory change \nin this regard could lead to fluctuation of prices of raw materials and thereby increase our operational cost. For details \non the laws applicable to us, please see \u201cKey Regulations and Policies in India\u201d on page 200. \nThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (\u201cIT Act\u201d) was amended to provide domestic companies an option to pay corporate income \ntax at the effective rate of approximately 25.17% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and health and education cess), as \ncompared to effective rate of 34.94% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and health and education cess), provided such \ncompanies do not claim certain specified deductions or exemptions. Further, where a company has opted to pay the \nreduced corporate tax rate, the minimum alternate tax provisions would not be applicable. Any such future amendments \nmay affect our ability to claim exemptions that we have historically benefited from, and such exemptions may no \nlonger be available to us. Any adverse order passed by the appellate authorities/ tribunals/ courts would have an effect \non our profitability. \nEarlier, distribution of dividends by a domestic company was subject to Dividend Distribution Tax (\u201cDDT\u201d), in the \nhands of the company and such dividends were generally exempt from tax in the hands of the shareholders. However, \nthe Government of India has amended the IT Act to abolish the DDT regime. Accordingly, any dividend distributed \nby a domestic company is subject to tax in the hands of the investor at the applicable rate. Additionally, the Company \nis required to withhold tax on such dividends distributed at the applicable rate.  \nIn addition, unfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and \nregulations including foreign investment laws governing our business, operations, and group structure could result in \nus being deemed to be in contravention of such laws or may require us to apply for additional approvals. We may incur \nincreased costs relating to compliance with such new requirements, which may also require management time and \nother resources, and any failure to comply may adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.  \nUnfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations \nincluding foreign investment and stamp duty laws governing our business and operations could result in us being \ndeemed to be in contravention of such laws and may require us to apply for additional approvals. Further, there is no \nassurance that the countries where our customers are located will not implement any new regulations and policies \nrequiring us to obtain approvals and licenses and/or will not impose onerous requirements and conditions on the export \nof our products to such countries. Any such decisions in future or any further changes in interpretation of laws may \nhave an impact on our results of operations.  \nSimilarly, changes in other laws may require additional compliances and/or result in us incurring additional \nexpenditure. Uncertainty in the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, \ngoverning law, regulation or policy, including by reason of an absence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial \nprecedent may be time consuming as well as costly for us to resolve and may impact the viability of our current \nbusinesses or restrict our ability to grow our businesses in the future.  \n58. \nWe may be affected by competition laws, the adverse application or interpretation of which could adversely affect \nour business including allegations of cartelization.  \nThe Competition Act, 2002, of India, as amended (\u201cCompetition Act\u201d), regulates practices having an appreciable \nadverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India (\u201cAAEC\u201d). Under the Competition Act, any formal or \ninformal arrangement, understanding, or action in concert, which causes or is likely to cause an AAEC is considered \nvoid and may result in the imposition of substantial penalties. Further, any agreement among competitors which \ndirectly or indirectly involves the determination of purchase or sale prices, limits or controls production, supply, \nmarkets, technical development, investment, or the provision of services or shares the market or source of production \nor provision of services in any manner, including by way of allocation of geographical area or number of customers \nin the relevant market or directly or indirectly results in bid-rigging or collusive bidding is presumed to have an \nappreciable AAEC and is considered void. The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any \nenterprise in the relevant point.  \nOn March 4, 2011, the Government notified and brought into force the combination regulation (merger control) \nprovisions under the Competition Act with effect from June 1, 2011. These provisions require acquisitions of shares, \nvoting rights, assets or control or mergers or amalgamations that cross the prescribed asset and turnover based \nthresholds to be mandatorily notified to and pre-approved by the Competition Commission of India (the \u201cCCI\u201d). \nAdditionally, on May 11, 2011, the CCI issued Competition Commission of India (Procedure for Transaction of \nBusiness Relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011, as amended, which sets out the mechanism for implementation \nof the merger control regime in India.  \n",

Consequently, all agreements entered by us could be within the purview of the Competition Act. Further, the \nCCI has extra-territorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive conduct, or combination occurring \noutside India if such agreement, conduct, or combination has an AAEC in India. \nHowever, the impact of the provisions of the Competition Act on the agreements entered into by us cannot be predicted \nwith certainty at this stage.  \nThe Government of India has also introduced the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2023 in the Lok Sabha on February \n8, 2023, which has proposed several amendments to Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022 introduced in the Lok Sabha \nin August, 2022 and the Competition Act. These amendments include the introduction of deal value thresholds for \nassessing whether a merger or acquisition qualifies as a \u201ccombination\u201d, expedited merger review timelines, \ncodification of the lowest standard of \u201ccontrol\u201d and enhanced penalties for providing false information or a failure to \nprovide material information. As these are draft amendments, we cannot ascertain at this stage whether the proposed \namendments will come into force in the form suggested or at all, their applicability, partially or at all, in respect of our \noperations once they come into force, or the extent to which the amendments, if and when they come into force, will \nresult in additional costs for compliance, which in turn may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash \nflows and prospects. However, if we are affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or interpretation of any \nprovision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the Competition Commission of India, \nor any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the Competition Commission of India \nor if any prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our \nbusiness and cash flows. \nHowever, if we are affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or interpretation of any provision of the \nCompetition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the Competition Commission of India, or any adverse \npublicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the Competition Commission of India or if any \nprohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our business and \ncash flows \n59. \nFinancial instability in other countries may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets. \nThe Indian market and the Indian economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries, \nincluding conditions in the United States, Europe and certain emerging economies in Asia. Financial turmoil in Asia, \nUnited States, United Kingdom, Russia and elsewhere in the world in recent years has adversely affected the Indian \neconomy. Any worldwide financial instability may cause increased volatility in the Indian financial markets and, \ndirectly or indirectly, adversely affect the Indian economy and financial sector and us. Although economic conditions \nvary across markets, loss of investor confidence in one emerging economy may cause increased volatility across other \neconomies, including India. Financial instability in other parts of the world could have a global influence and thereby \nnegatively affect the Indian economy. Financial disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, \nprospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, economic developments globally can have \na significant impact on our principal markets. Concerns related to a trade war between large economies may lead to \nincreased risk aversion and volatility in global capital markets and consequently have an impact on the Indian \neconomy.  \nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material \nadverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce \nglobal market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict \nour access to capital. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of \noperations and reduce the price of the Equity Shares. \n60. \nInvestors may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us, our Directors, the Book Running \nLead Managers or any of their directors and executive officers in India respectively, except by way of a law suit in \nIndia.  \nOur Company is a company incorporated under the laws of India and all of our Directors are located in India. All of \nour assets, our Key Managerial Personnel and officers are also located in India. As a result, it may not be possible for \ninvestors to effect service of process upon our Company or such persons in jurisdictions outside India, or to enforce \njudgments obtained against such parties outside India.  \nRecognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is provided for under Section 13 and Section 44A of the Code of \nCivil Procedure, 1908. India is not party to any international treaty in relation to the recognition or enforcement of \nforeign judgments. India has reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters \nwith only a limited number of jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Hong \nKong.

Judgments or decrees from jurisdictions which do not have reciprocal recognition \nwith India, including the United States, cannot be enforced by proceedings in execution in India. Therefore, a final \njudgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in a non-reciprocating territory for civil liability, whether \nor not predicated solely upon the general laws of the non-reciprocating territory, would not be directly enforceable in \nIndia. The party in whose favour a final foreign judgment in a non-reciprocating territory is rendered may bring a fresh \nsuit in a competent court in India based on the final judgment within three years of obtaining such final judgment. \nHowever, it is unlikely that a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action \nwere brought in India or that an Indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as \nexcessive or inconsistent with the public policy in India. Further, there is no assurance that a suit brought in an Indian \ncourt in relation to a foreign judgment will be disposed of in a timely manner. In addition, any person seeking to \nenforce a foreign judgment in India is required to obtain the prior approval of the RBI to repatriate any amount \nrecovered, and we cannot assure that such approval will be forthcoming within a reasonable period of time, or at all, \nor that conditions of such approval would be acceptable. Such amount may also be subject to income tax in accordance \nwith applicable law. \n61. \nThe trading volume and market price of the Equity Shares may be volatile following the Offer. \nThe market price of the Equity Shares may fluctuate as a result of, among other things, the following factors, some of \nwhich are beyond our control: \n\u2022 \nquarterly variations in our results of operations; \n\u2022 \nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; \n\u2022 \nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors; \n\u2022 \nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by research \nanalysts and investors; \n\u2022 \na change in research analysts\u2019 recommendations; \n\u2022 \nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint operations or \ncapital commitments; \n\u2022 \nannouncements by third parties or governmental entities of significant claims or proceedings against us; \n\u2022 \nnew laws and governmental regulations applicable to our industry; \n\u2022 \nadditions or departures of key management personnel; \n\u2022 \nchanges in exchange rates; \n\u2022 \nfluctuations in volume of Equity Shares traded; and \n\u2022 \ngeneral economic and stock market conditions. \nChanges in relation to any of the factors listed above could adversely affect the price of the Equity Shares. \n62. \nFluctuation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on \nthe value of our Equity Shares, independent of our results of operations and cash flows. \nOn listing, our Equity Shares will be quoted in Indian Rupees on the Stock Exchanges.

Any adverse movement in currency exchange rates during the time taken for such \nconversion may reduce the net dividend to foreign investors. In addition, any adverse movement in currency exchange \nrates during a delay in repatriating the proceeds from a sale of Equity Shares outside India, for example, because of a \ndelay in regulatory approvals that may be required for the sale of Equity Shares may reduce the proceeds received by \nShareholders. For example, the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated substantially \nin recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future, which may have an adverse effect on the \nreturns on our Equity Shares, independent of our operating results. \n",

A securities transaction tax (\u201cSTT\u201d) is levied on and collected by an \nIndian stock exchange on which equity shares are sold. Any gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for \nmore than 12 months may be subject to long-term capital gains tax in India at the specified rates depending on certain \nfactors, such as STT paid, the quantum of gains and any available treaty exemptions. Accordingly, you may be subject \nto payment of long-term capital gains tax in India, in addition to payment of STT, on the sale of any Equity Shares \nheld for more than 12 months. Further, any gain realized on the sale of our Equity Shares held for a period of 12 \nmonths or less will be subject to short-term capital gains tax in India. While non-residents may claim tax treaty benefits \nin relation to such capital gains income, generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India\u2019s right to impose tax on capital \ngains arising from the sale of shares of an Indian company. \nOur Company cannot predict whether any tax laws or other regulations impacting it will be enacted, or predict the \nnature and impact of any such laws or regulations or whether, if at all, any laws or regulations would have a material \nadverse effect on our Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n64. \nInvestors will not be able to sell immediately on an Indian stock exchange any of the Equity Shares they purchase \nin the Offer. \nThe Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchanges. Pursuant to applicable Indian laws, certain actions must be \ncompleted before the Equity Shares can be listed and trading in the Equity Shares may commence. Investors\u2019 book \nentry, or \u2018demat\u2019 accounts with depository participants in India, are expected to be credited within one working day \nof the date on which the Basis of Allotment is approved by the Stock Exchanges. The Allotment of Equity Shares in \nthe Offer and the credit of such Equity Shares to the applicant\u2019s demat account with depository participant could take \napproximately five Working Days from the Bid/ Offer Closing Date and trading in the Equity Shares upon receipt of \nfinal listing and trading approvals from the Stock Exchanges is expected to commence within six Working Days of \nthe Bid/ Offer Closing Date. There could be a failure or delay in listing of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges \npursuant to changes in applicable law or otherwise. Any failure or delay in obtaining the approval or otherwise \ncommence trading in the Equity Shares would restrict investors\u2019 ability to dispose of their Equity Shares. There can \nbe no assurance that the Equity Shares will be credited to investors\u2019 demat accounts, or that trading in the Equity \nShares will commence, within the time periods specified in this risk factor. We could also be required to pay interest \nat the applicable rates if allotment is not made, refund orders are not dispatched or demat credits are not made to \ninvestors within the prescribed time periods. \n65. \nAny future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity linked instruments by us may dilute \nyour shareholding and sale of Equity Shares by shareholders with significant shareholding may adversely affect \nthe trading price of the Equity Shares. \nWe may be required to finance our growth through future equity offerings. Any future equity issuances by us, including \na primary offering of Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares may lead to the dilution \nof investors\u2019 shareholdings in our Company. Any future equity issuances by us or sales of our Equity Shares by our \nshareholders may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares, which may lead to other adverse \nconsequences including difficulty in raising capital through offering of our Equity Shares or incurring additional debt. \nIn addition, any perception by investors that such issuances or sales might occur may also affect the market price of \nour Equity Shares. There can be no assurance that we will not issue Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities \nlinked to Equity Shares or that our Shareholders will not dispose of, pledge or encumber their Equity Shares in the \nfuture. \n66. \nUnder Indian law, foreign investors are subject to investment restrictions that limit our ability to attract foreign \ninvestors, which may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. \nUnder foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfer of shares between non-residents and residents \nare freely permitted (subject to certain restrictions), if they comply with the pricing guidelines and reporting \nrequirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which are sought to be transferred, is not in compliance \nwith such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or falls under any of the exceptions referred to above, then a \nprior regulatory approval will be required. Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert Rupee proceeds from a sale \nof shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India require a no-objection or a tax \nclearance certificate from the Indian income tax authorities.  \nIn addition, pursuant to the Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series), dated April 17, 2020, issued by the DPIIT, which has been \nincorporated as the proviso to Rule 6(a) of the FEMA Rules, investments where the beneficial owner of the equity \nshares is situated in or is a citizen of a country which shares a land border with India, can only be made through the \n",

These investment \nrestrictions shall also apply to subscribers of offshore derivative instruments. \nWe cannot assure investors that any required approval from the RBI or any other governmental agency can be obtained \non any particular terms or at all. For further information, see \u201cRestrictions on Foreign Ownership of Indian Securities\u201d \non page 356. \n67. \nSignificant differences exist between Ind AS and other accounting principles, such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS, which \ninvestors may be more familiar with and may consider material to their assessment of our financial condition. \nOur Restated Consolidated Financial Information for Fiscal 2022, 2022 and 2023 have been derived from the: (ii) \naudited Ind AS financial statements of our Company as at and for the years ended March 31, 2024 prepared in \naccordance with the Ind AS as prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting \nStandards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India; (iii) audited special \npurpose Ind AS financial statements of our Company as at and for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, \n2022. The special purpose Ind AS financial statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, \n2022 have been prepared after making suitable adjustments to the accounting heads from their Indian GAAP (values \nfollowing accounting policies and accounting policy choices (both mandatory exceptions and optional exemptions \navailed, as per Ind AS 101) consistent with that used at the date of transition to Ind AS (April 1, 2022) and as per the \npresentation, accounting policies and grouping/classifications including revised Schedule III disclosures followed as \nat and for the Financial Year ended March 31, 2024. The aforementioned financial statements have been restated in \naccordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the ICAI Guidance Note. Ind AS differs in certain significant respects \nfrom Indian GAAP, IFRS, U.S. GAAP and other accounting principles with which prospective investors may be \nfamiliar in other countries. If our financial statements were to be prepared in accordance with such other accounting \nprinciples, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be substantially different. Prospective \ninvestors should review the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements, and consult their \nown professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between these accounting principles and those with \nwhich they may be more familiar. Any reliance by persons not familiar with Indian accounting practices on the \nfinancial disclosures presented in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus should be limited accordingly. \n68. \nThe determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions and the Offer Price of the Equity \nShares may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares after the Offer. Further, the current market \nprice of some securities listed pursuant to certain previous issues managed by the Book Running Lead Managers \nis below their respective offer prices. \nThe determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions, and will be determined by our \nCompany and the Selling Shareholders in consultation with the BRLMs. Furthermore, the Offer Price of the Equity \nShares will be determined by our Company and Selling Shareholders in consultation with the BRLMs through the \nBook Building Process. These will be based on numerous factors, including factors as described under \u201cBasis for Offer \nPrice\u201d on page 105 and may not be indicative of the market price for the Equity Shares after the Offer. \nIn addition to the above, the current market price of securities listed pursuant to certain previous initial public offerings \nmanaged by the BRLMs is below their respective offer price. For further details, see \u201cOther Regulatory and Statutory \nDisclosures \u2013 Price information of past issues handled by the BRLMs\u201d on page 320. The factors that could affect the \nmarket price of the Equity Shares include, among others, broad market trends, financial performance and results of \nour Company post-listing, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that an active market will \ndevelop or sustained trading will take place in the Equity Shares or provide any assurance regarding the price at which \nthe Equity Shares will be traded after listing.  \n69. \nQIBs and Non-Institutional Investors are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of \nEquity Shares or the Bid amount) at any stage after submitting a bid, and Retail Individual Investors are not \npermitted to withdraw their Bids after Bid/Offer Closing Date.  \nPursuant to the SEBI ICDR Regulations, QIBs and Non-Institutional Investors are required to block the Bid amount \non submission of the Bid and are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of equity shares \nor the Bid Amount) at any stage after submitting a Bid. Similarly, Retail Individual Investors can revise or withdraw \ntheir Bids at any time during the Bid/Offer Period and until the Bid/ Offer Closing date, but not thereafter.

Therefore, Bidders will not be able to withdraw or lower their bids following adverse \ndevelopments in international or national monetary policy, financial, political or economic conditions, our business, \nresults of operations, cash flows or otherwise between the dates of submission of their Bids and Allotment. \n70. \nHolders of Equity Shares may be restricted in their ability to exercise pre-emptive rights under Indian law and \nthereby may suffer future dilution of their ownership position. \nUnder the Companies Act, a company having share capital and incorporated in India must offer its holders of equity \nshares pre-emptive rights to subscribe and pay for a proportionate number of equity shares to maintain their existing \nownership percentages before the issuance of any new equity shares, unless the pre-emptive rights have been waived \nby adoption of a special resolution. However, if the laws of the jurisdiction the investors are located in does not permit \nthem to exercise their pre-emptive rights without our filing an offering document or registration statement with the \napplicable authority in such jurisdiction, the investors will be unable to exercise their pre-emptive rights unless we \nmake such a filing. If we elect not to file a registration statement, the new securities may be issued to a custodian, who \nmay sell the securities for the investor\u2019s benefit. The value the custodian receives on the sale of such securities and the \nrelated transaction costs cannot be predicted. In addition, to the extent that the investors are unable to exercise pre-\nemption rights granted in respect of the Equity Shares held by them, their proportional interest in us would be reduced. \n71. \nRights of shareholders of companies under Indian law may be more limited than under the laws of other \njurisdictions. \nOur Articles of Association, composition of our Board, Indian laws governing our corporate affairs, the validity of \ncorporate procedures, directors\u2019 fiduciary duties, responsibilities and liabilities, and shareholders\u2019 rights may differ \nfrom those that would apply to a company in another jurisdiction. Shareholders\u2019 rights under Indian law may not be \nas extensive and wide-spread as shareholders' rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions. Investors may \nface challenges in asserting their rights as shareholder of our Company than as a shareholder of an entity in another \njurisdiction. \n72. \nCompliance with provisions of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may affect payments on the Equity Shares. \nThe U.S. \u201cForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\u201d (or \u201cFATCA\u201d) imposes a new reporting regime and potentially, \nimposes a 30% withholding tax on certain \u201cforeign passthru payments\u201d made by certain non-U.S. financial institutions \n(including intermediaries). If payments on the Equity Shares are made by such non-U.S. financial institutions \n(including intermediaries), this withholding may be imposed on such payments if made to any non-U.S. financial \ninstitution (including an intermediary) that is not otherwise exempt from FATCA or other holders who do not provide \nsufficient identifying information to the payer, to the extent such payments are considered \u201cforeign passthru \npayments\u201d. Under current guidance, the term \u201cforeign passthru payment\u201d is not defined and it is therefore not clear \nwhether and to what extent payments on the Equity Shares would be considered \u201cforeign passthru payments\u201d. The \nUnited States has entered into intergovernmental agreements with many jurisdictions (including India) that modify the \nFATCA withholding regime described above. It is not yet clear how the intergovernmental agreements between the \nUnited States and these jurisdictions will address \u201cforeign passthru payments\u201d and whether such agreements will \nrequire us or other financial institutions to withhold or report on payments on the Equity Shares to the extent they are \ntreated as \u201cforeign passthru payments\u201d. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the \nconsequences of FATCA, or any intergovernmental agreement or non-U.S. legislation implementing FATCA, to their \ninvestment in Equity Shares. \n \n \n",

See \n\u201cRisk Factors- Our funding requirements and proposed deployment of the Net Proceeds are based on management estimates \nand may be subject to change based on various factors, some of which are beyond our control..\u201d on page 37.

Global growth, was 4.1% in CY 2023, \nis estimated to remain at 4.5% in CY 2024 before rising modestly to 5% in CY 2026. Compared with CY 2023, the forecast for \nCY 2024 is about 0.4 percentage points higher, reflecting upgrades for China, US, large emerging economies and developing \neconomies. Emerging economies and developing economies are expected to experience stable growth through CY 2024 and \nCY 2025, with regional differences. \nGrowth in China is projected at 4.6% in CY 2024 and 4.1% in CY 2025, with an upward revision of 0.4 percentage point for \nCY 2024 since CY 2023. The upgrade reflects carryover from stronger-than expected growth in CY 2023 and increased \ngovernment spending on capacity building against natural disasters. \n1.1. \nReview and outlook of global GDP and GDP growth CY 2018 - 2028P \n \n1.2. \nOutlook of real GDP growth in key global economies CY 2018 - 2028P \nTable 1: Real GDP growth (%) comparison of major economies with world \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024E \n2025P \n2026P \n2027P \n2028P \nUS \n3.0% \n2.5% \n-2.2% \n5.8% \n1.9% \n2.5% \n2.7% \n1.9% \n2.0% \n2.1% \n2.1% \nChina \n6.8% \n6.0% \n2.2% \n8.4% \n3.0% \n5.2% \n4.6% \n4.1% \n3.8% \n3.6% \n3.4% \nEurope \n2.3% \n2.0% \n-5.4% \n6.3% \n2.5% \n1.0% \n1.4% \n1.8% \n1.7% \n1.6% \n1.6% \nJapan \n0.6% \n-0.4% \n-4.1% \n2.6% \n1.0% \n1.9% \n0.9% \n1.0% \n0.8% \n0.6% \n0.6% \nIndia \n6.8% \n6.5% \n3.9% -5.8% \n9.7% \n7.0% \n8.2% \n6.5% \n6.5% \n6.5% \n6.5% \n",

The drivers of declining inflation differ by country but generally reflect lower core \ninflation as a result of still-tight monetary policies, a related softening in labour markets, and pass-through effects from earlier \nand ongoing declines in relative energy prices. \nTable 2: Inflation rate, average consumer prices (% change Y-o-Y) \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024E \n2025P \n2026P \n2027P \n2028P \nWorld \n3.6% \n3.5% \n3.2% \n4.7% \n8.7% \n6.8% \n5.9% \n4.5% \n3.7% \n3.5% \n3.4% \nUS \n2.4% \n1.8% \n1.2% \n4.7% \n8.0% \n4.1% \n2.9% \n2.0% \n2.1% \n2.1% \n2.1% \nChina \n2.1% \n2.9% \n2.5% \n0.9% \n2.0% \n0.2% \n1.0% \n2.0% \n2.0% \n2.0% \n2.0% \nEurope \n2.2% \n2.0% \n1.1% \n3.5% \n9.9% \n6.3% \n3.4% \n2.7% \n2.5% \n2.4% \n2.4% \nJapan \n1.0% \n0.5% \n0.0% \n-0.2% \n2.5% \n3.3% \n2.2% \n2.1% \n2.0% \n2.0% \n2.0% \nIndia \n3.4% \n4.8% \n6.2% \n5.5% \n6.7% \n5.4% \n4.6% \n4.2% \n4.1% \n4.0% \n4.0% \nSource: IMF \nNote: All data are based on calendar year; E: Estimated data; P: Projected data \nOverall, about 80% of the world\u2019s economies are expected to see lower annual average headline and core inflation in CY 2024. \nMost of these economies are expected to reach their targets (or target range midpoints) by CY 2025. In several major economies, \nthe downward revision to the projected path of inflation, combined with a modest upgrade to economic activity, implies a softer-\nthan-expected landing. \n1.4. \nUrbanization trends across globe \nOver 56% of the world\u2019s population lived in urban areas in CY 2019; by CY 2050, this proportion will grow to two-thirds. The \nUnited Nations calls urbanization one of four \u201cdemographic mega-trends\u201d (UNDESA 2019), along with population growth, \naging, and international migration. Yet patterns of urbanization are highly heterogeneous, both within and across countries. \nAsia and Africa will see both the largest numbers of urban dwellers and the fastest growth in urbanization. \n \n1.5. \nOverview of the emerging geo-political scenario \nPolitical scientists\u2019 conjecture that the emergence of China as a new superpower against the incumbent US might lead to strategic competition \nbetween these countries \u2014one in which geopolitical forces and the desire to limit interdependence take primacy over win-win international \ncooperation. Rising support for populist and isolationist parties in many Western countries points towards the same direction. Additionally, \nthe CY 2022 War in Ukraine and the subsequent strong retaliation of the European Union, US, and their allies against Russia suggest that the \ninternational economic order based on open markets and expanded globalization could be replaced by a more fragmented international \neconomic system. \n",

Escalating trade tensions, \nparticularly between China and US, have led to the imposition of tariffs and trade barriers, dampening the flow of goods between \nthe two economic powerhouses. Concurrently, geopolitical concerns, such as territorial disputes and human rights issues, have \nprompted some countries to reassess their trade relations with China. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated \nexisting disruptions to global supply chains, further impacting trade flows. Moreover, rising labour costs in China and efforts \nto diversify supply chains have prompted companies to seek alternative manufacturing bases, contributing to the declining \ntrend. While China remains a key player in the global economy, these factors collectively underline a significant recalibration \nin trade patterns. Imports of some major economies is illustrated below. Imports from China in major markets have declined in \npast 5 years. \n \n1.7. \nImpact on trade due to conflicts in Middle East \nThe Red Sea, a critical conduit for 30% of the world's container traffic, is currently facing a shipping crisis of unprecedented \nscale. The recent economic and social developments and special issues is in difficult situations in the Middle East and North \nAfrica (MENA), is due to the impact of the Red Sea shipping crisis. The recent conflict in the Middle East has led to attacks on \ncommercial vessels, causing a significant downturn in maritime activity. As of end-March CY 2024, the volume of traffic \nthrough the strategic Suez Canal and Bab El-Mandeb Strait has dropped 50%, while the alternative route via the Cape of Good \nHope route has witnessed a 100% increase in navigation. This crisis has far-reaching implications, not only for the shipping \nindustry but also for the environment and the global economy. The longer routes required by the current situation have increased \ntravel distances for cargo and tankers by up to 53%, causing a rise in CO2 emissions due to the additional fuel burned. \n",

However, \nby the end of CY 2022, the global economic environment worsened with the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and \naccompanying sanctions. Global commodity prices shot up substantially across the board amidst volatility, and crude oil prices \njumped to a 10-year high in June CY 2022. This spurred inflation globally, which affected India\u2019s external account and price \nsituation. Supply chain pressures, which were set to ease after the pandemic, were rising again. Elevated edible oil prices due \nto global supply chain disruptions and higher vegetable prices due to uneven weather conditions led to high food inflation. \nThus, the beginning of CY 2023 presented fresh, multi-frontal challenges to keeping macro vulnerabilities in check. However, \nIndia managed to keep its retail inflation below the levels of several other countries. The war in Ukraine and US sanctions led \nto supply disruptions and price volatility. \n",

Further, we have demonstrated capability in quickly \nlaunching new products to meet market demands. \n \nWe keep a close track of changes in customer demand and through our R&D, we have developed certain various categories of \ninnovative products such as (i) wall and ceiling panels such as decorative embossed panels that replicate finishes like marble, \nwood, and stone, while also addressing functional and practical challenges, (ii) profiles / mouldings such as pre-mitered profiles \nand kits for various applications, (iii) columns, and (iv) graphic educational-aid. Our continued focus on R&D has been \ninstrumental to the growth of our operations and has improved our ability to innovate products. Our revenue from operations \nfrom the innovative products has increased from \u20b9 1,039.63 million in Fiscal 2022 representing 41.49% of our revenue from \noperations for Fiscal 2022 to \u20b9 2,230.60 million in Fiscal 2024, representing 54.68% of our revenue from operations for Fiscal \n2024 at a CAGR of 46.48%.The rise in revenue from operations from the sale of innovative products demonstrates our \nCompany\u2019s success in developing our own branded products in key markets, thereby gaining traction with end customers. \n \nWe have developed the ability to turnaround a product, based on customer requirements, from concept to sale in a timely \nmanner, leveraging on the deep understanding of material science and R&D. This is substantiated by way of the following case \nstudies: \n \nCase Studies \nCase study A \n \nIn March 2020, we began developing a replacement for ceramic tiles for the use of wall tiles/planks in collaboration with \none of our customers. The customer requested for a product that was lightweight, strong, scratch-resistant, easy to install \nand aesthetically pleasing. We developed a product over a period of six-months, our product was subsequently approved by \nthe customer and we dispatched our first order in September 2020. This co-development process resulted in a product that \ncontributed 8% of our revenue from operations for Fiscal 2024 and the customer today holds top 5 position in our customer \nportfolio. This reflects the ability of our R&D to drive innovation and business growth. \nCase study B \n \nWe were exploring the possibility of a Quick-Step (stair solution) which could be installed quickly and efficiently as a pre-\nfinished veneer look product reducing installation costs. In April 2019, we received drawings from our customer to develop \nsuch a pre-finished stair-solution. From receiving the product details to dispatching our first order post trials and approvals, \nour turn-around time was three-months. We received subsequent orders defining the success of our program and our R&D \ninitiatives. \n \nOur R&D capabilities enable us to explore, among others, continuous processes, which will offer us competitive advantages \ngoing forward. As of June 30, 2024, our R&D team comprised 9 employees and we have manufactured 900 SKUs. \n \nEstablished credentials in developed markets with repeat business from large-scale customers \n \nWe believe that \u201cECHON\u201d has become a trustworthy brand among our customers, both in domestic and international markets. \nThis is demonstrated by the fact that we have exported our products to 15 countries, as of June 30, 2024 and our Company has \nreceived registration from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) as a three \u2013 star export house and recently awarded \n\u2018Best Exporter\u2019 at the Rajasthan Business Summit organized by The Economic Times. We have a distribution foothold in the \nUSA, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Poland, Netherlands, Portugal, and Canada. \n \nWe have an extensive customer base and established strong relationships with a range of customers through our ability to offer \nbasic to specialized PVC blend-based building material products, a solution-focused approach to meet their needs and co-\ndeveloping products. This also enables us to cross-sell and upsell our products to our customers. We have a well-established \nglobal footprint, across 15 countries as of June 30, 2024. We sell our products to distributors, who further supply to traders, \nfabricators and retailers in their respective countries. Our network includes three largest home improvement/DIY stores in the \nUSA, having presence of over 4,400 stores (Source: Wazir Report). We believe that the diversification of our end \u2013 use customer \nbase across residential, commercial and industrial sectors has enabled us to minimize the impact of segment \u2013 specific \nconcentration on our business operations and prospects.  \n \nWe are the largest exporters of PVC blend-based building material products in India, as on March 31, 2024 Our major share of \nexports comes from regulated markets such as USA, which typically has more stringent quality and regulatory requirements, \nfurther underscoring the quality standards of our operations. The USA is the largest and one of the most mature markets for \nPVC blend-based building materials, dominated by leading DIY retailers and key distributors. These players have established \nstringent standards for product quality and production processes, and their acceptance is a mark of product quality. We have \nbeen exporting to USA for the last 20 years, consistently supplying products while expanding our range to compete with the \nUSA brands. \n",

To support our expansion plans we have recently acquired a 19.4- \nacre facility in Virginia, USA, which, if required, can be converted into a manufacturing facility to meet demands of our \ncustomers in the USA. It would also enable us to serve key market segments while offering the prestigious 'Made in USA' label, \nboosting our penetration in the USA market. We believe establishing a presence in international markets would facilitate our \nsales, marketing and business development activities by being closer to certain customers, and also provide us with timely \ninsights into the economic, product requirements and regulatory environment in such markets. We intend to increase our export \nsales by increasing our distribution network targeting different customer segments in existing markets in addition to targeting \nnew export markets to sell our products. \n \nExpand capacities, strengthen supply chain and invest in technological advancement to improve utilisation levels and bring \nin operational efficiencies \n \nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to enhance our production capacity in India by establishing a new facility at Udaipur, \nRajasthan, spread across 97,000 square metres. The land on which the facility is intended to be set up is owned by us. The \nproposed facility will enable us to increase our installed capacity and is designed to be fungible providing us the competitive \nadvantage of manufacturing products based on market demand. This will enhance our total installed capacity across our facilities \nfrom 27,600 MTPA to 117,600 MTPA and will not only cater to the untapped Indian market but also cater to the need of export \nmarket. The aggregate capacity utilisation of our facilities was 65.07% for Fiscal 2024. For details, see \u2018- Capacity Utilisation\u2019 \non page 183.  \nWith our experience and understanding of the PVC blend-based building material products, we identified the need for auxiliary \nmanufacturing capabilities in the USA. As a result, we acquired a 19.4- acre facility in Virginia, USA, which can be converted \ninto a manufacturing facility to meet demands of our customers in the USA. Based on the assessment of the requirements of \nthe USA market and our customers therefrom, we might consider setting up a manufacturing facility at our facility in Virginia, \nUSA. This facility, acquired in July 2023, is strategically located with direct access to state highway and adjacent to a railway \nline on the East Coast. The location positions us within our core market on the East Coast of the USA, enhancing our logistics \nand distribution capabilities. We believe that this would improve operational efficiency by reducing delivery cost and delivery \ntime from 45 days to 7-10 days. \nOur supply chain strategy focuses on optimizing logistics operations, diversifying logistics partners, and expanding our network \nwithin the USA., We provide delivery within 15 to 21 days of purchase orders in India and within 40 to 50 days of purchase \norders outside India, through third-party logistics service providers. Our third-party logistics service providers execute our \ndeliveries and ensure smooth and efficient delivery of products from our warehouses to our customers. This distributed supply \nchain network helps us to control our logistics and overhead costs while maximizing customer satisfaction. We intend to adopt \nsustainable logistics practices and develop contingency plans to mitigate global supply chain disruptions, ensuring a robust and \nreliable supply chain that supports our global expansion efforts. \n \n",

The extruder heats and melts the PVC \nmixture while simultaneously injecting foaming agents into it. \n\u2022 \nThe molten PVC blend-based mixture containing the blowing agents is forced through a die with \nthe desired shape and thickness of the product \n\u2022 \nAs the extruded PVC exits the die, it expands due to the release of gas, forming a cellular structure \nwithin the material. \nCooling and sizing \n \n\u2022 \nThe extruded PVC blend-based product sheet is passed through a series of cooling rollers or a \nwater bath to rapidly cool and solidify the material. \n\u2022 \nOnce cooled, the PVC blend-based product is trimmed and cut to the desired dimensions using \ncutting machines. \nSurface treatment (optional) \n\u2022 \nDepending on the application and desired properties, the surface of the product undergoes \nadditional treatment processes such as embossing, printing, or laminating. \nQuality control \n \n\u2022 \nThroughout the manufacturing process, quality control checks are performed to ensure that the \nproduct meet the specified standards for dimensions, density, strength, and other properties. \nPackaging and storage \n \n\u2022 \nOnce the product pass quality control inspections, they are packaged according to customer \nrequirements. \n\u2022 \n Packaging helps protect the product from damage during transportation and storage \nDistribution and sales \n\u2022 \nThe packaged PVC blend-based product are then distributed to customers through various \nchannels, including wholesalers, retailers, and direct sales. \n \nJ.Z \nUtilities \nPower and Fuel  \nOur manufacturing processes require uninterrupted and constant voltage power to ensure that the products are of high quality \nand also to increase the productivity and lifetime of our machines and equipment. We also have particular power requirements \ndue to the need to process raw materials to get final products within a particular range of temperatures. We depend on state \nelectricity supply for our power requirements and electricity generated through solar panels installed at our Facilities and utilise \ndiesel generators to ensure that our facilities are operational during power failures or other emergencies.  \n \nWater \n \nOur manufacturing processes also require water consumption although they are not water intensive. The requirement for water \nat our facilities is primarily met through borewells and we have obtained permission under the Environment Act for extraction \nof groundwater from the Central Ground Water Authority. In order to reduce wastage of water, we undertake water conservation \nmeasures on an ongoing basis and undertake treatment of wastewater for its reuse in compliance with local water usage and \ntreatment guidelines. \n \nThe table below sets forth details relating to our expenses on power, fuel and water as a percentage of our revenue from \noperations in Fiscal 2022, 2023 and 2024: \n",

These costs are recognised in the profit or loss over the tenure of the borrowing as \npart of the interest expense by applying the effective interest rate method. Under previous GAAP, these transaction costs were charged \nto profit or loss as and when incurred. \n \n4. \nSecurity deposits: Under the previous GAAP, interest free security deposits (that are refundable in cash on completion of the term) are \nrecorded at their transaction value. Under Ind AS, all financial assets are required to be recognised at fair value. \n \n5. \nRight of use assets and Lease liability: The company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date \nthe underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated \nimpairment losses. The company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease \n",

These liabilities are classified as amortized cost. \n \nSubsequent measurement \n \nThese liabilities include are borrowings and deposits. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortized cost using \nthe effective interest method. \n \nDe-recognition of financial liabilities \n \nA financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial \nliability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially \nmodified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognized of the original liability and the recognized of a new liability. The \ndifference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. \n \nOffsetting of financial instruments \n \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal \nright to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities \nsimultaneously. \n \n1.6. Impairment of assets: \n \nFinancial Asset \n \nA financials Asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset \nis considered to be impaired, if objective evidence indicates that one or more events had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows \nof that asset. \n \nNon-Financial Asset \n \nThe carrying amount of non-financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to ascertain whether there is any indication of impairment. If \nany such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognized, as an expense in the statement \nof profit and loss, for the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher \nof an asset fair value less cost to sale and value in use. Value in use is ascertained through discounting of the estimated future cash flows \nusing a discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the assets. \n \nAn impairment loss is reversed if there is any change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is \nreversed only to the extent that the asset carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of \ndepreciation or amortisation, if no impairment has been recognized. \n \n1.7. Inventories: \n \na. \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of raw materials, packing materials and stores, spares and \nconsumables includes all charges incurred in bringing the goods to the warehouse, including any levies, transit insurance and \nreceiving charges.  \n \nb. \nCosts of Finished Goods and Work-in-Progress are determined on specific identification basis by taking material cost [net of GST], \nlabour and relevant appropriate overheads. Cost of raw materials and packing material are determined on specific identification \nbasis by taking material cost [net of GST]. \n \n1.8. Cash and cash equivalents: \n \nCash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and at banks, short-term deposits (with an original maturity of three months or less from \nthe date of acquisition), and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of statement of cash flows, cash and \ncash equivalents consist of cash and short term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding book overdrafts , if any, as they are considered \nan integral part of the company's cash management. \n \n1.9. Borrowing Costs: \n \nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized during the period of \ntime that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.

Earnings Per Share: \n \nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average \nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share as the company does \nnot have any dilutive potential equity shares outstanding. The number of equity shares are adjusted for share splits and bonus shares, as \nappropriate. \n \n1.11. Taxes on Income: \n \nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax expense. Income tax expenses are recognized in statement of profit and loss, except \nwhen they relate to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, income tax expenses are also \nrecognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. \n \nCurrent tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of reporting period \nby the governing taxation laws, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Income tax assets and liabilities are measured \nat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax \nreturns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. \n \nDeferred taxes arising from deductible and taxable temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying \namount in the financial statements are recognized using substantively enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the \nyears in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled. Deferred tax asset are recognized only to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount \nof deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit \nwill be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax assets to be utilized. \n \n1.12. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: \n \nProvisions \n \nProvisions are recognized only when there is a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will \nbe required to settle the obligation in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made.  \n \nContingent liability  \n \nIt is disclosed for: \n \na. \nPossible obligations which will be confirmed only by future events not wholly within the control of the company, or \nb. \nPresent obligations arising from past events where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation \nor a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. \n \nContingent Assets \n \nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Contingent assets are not recognised and \ndisclosed only when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. \n \n1.13. Leases: \n \n\"The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 \"\"Leases\"\". At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a \nlease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \nfor consideration. \n \nThe Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date except for leases with a term of twelve \nmonths or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the lease payments associated with these \nleases are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a written down value basis over the lease term. Lease term is a non-\ncancellable period together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; \nand periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. \n \nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \nmade at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the \nunderlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset \nis subsequently depreciated using the written down value method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease \ntransfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Company by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the \n",

In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. In \naddition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease \nliability. \n \nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid over the lease term at the commencement date, \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. \nGenerally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised \ncost using the effective interest method.\" \n \nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \nflows. \n \n1.14. Foreign currency transactions and translation: \n \nTransactions in foreign currencies entered into by the Company are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. \nForeign currency monetary assets and liabilities remaining unsettled at the end of the year are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the \nend of the year. All differences arising on settlement/restatement are adjusted in the statement of profit and loss.  \n \n1.15. Employee Benefits: \n \n1. \nDefined contribution plan: The Company's contribution to provident fund and employee state insurance scheme are defined contribution \nplans and are charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution required to be made as and when services are rendered by the \nemployees. \n \n2. \nDefined benefit obligations plan: \n \ni. \nThe liability for the defined benefit plan of Gratuity is determined on the basis of an actuarial valuation done by an independent \nactuary at the year end, which is calculated using projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses which comprise experience \nadjustment and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in Other comprehensive income in the period in which \nthey occur. \n \nii. \nThe Company also provides benefit of compensated absences to its employees which are in the nature of long -term benefit plan. \nProvision for compensated absences is made on the basis of actuarial valuation carried out at the Balance Sheet date. The Company \nrecognises actuarial gains and losses that arise due to difference in the actual experience and the assumed parameters and also due \nto changes in the assumptions used for valuation, in the statement of Profit and Loss, as income or expense. \n \n3. \nShort-term employee benefits \n \nShort-term employee benefits comprise of employee costs such as salaries, bonus etc. which are recognized on the basis of the amount paid \nor payable for the period during which services are rendered by the employee. \n \n1.16. Measurement of Profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation \n \nThe Company has opted to present profit before interest (finance cost), tax, depreciation and amortization as a separate line item on the face \nof the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year. The Company measures profit before interest (finance cost), tax, depreciation and amortization \nbased on profit/(loss) from continuing operations. \n \n \n \n",

Financial Risk Management \n \nThe Company\u2019s financial liabilities comprise mainly of borrowings, trade, other payables and financial assets comprise mainly of investments, \ncash and cash equivalents, other balances with banks, loans, trade receivables and other receivables. The Company is exposed to Market risk, \nCredit risk and Liquidity risk. The Board of the Company monitors the risk as per risk management policy. Further The Audit Committee has \nadditional oversight in the area of financial risks and controls. The following disclosures summarize the Company\u2019s exposure to financial \nrisks and information regarding use of derivatives employed to manage exposures to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analysis have been \nprovided to reflect the impact of reasonably possible changes in market rates on the financial results, cash flows and financial position of the \nCompany. \n \n(a) Market risk: Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in \nmarket prices. Market risk for the Company comprises two types of risks: interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected \nby market risk includes borrowings, investments, trade payables, trade receivables and loans. Within the various methodologies to analyse \nand manage risk, Company has implemented a system based on \u201csensitivity analysis\u201d on symmetric basis. This tool enables the risk managers \nto identify the risk position of the entities. Sensitivity analysis provides an approximate quantification of the exposure in the event that certain \nspecified parameters were to be met under a specific set of assumptions. The risk estimates provided here assume: \n- a parallel shift of 100-basis points of the interest rate yield curves in major currencies. \n- a simultaneous, parallel foreign exchange rates shift in which the INR appreciates / depreciates against all currencies by 5% \n \n",

The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily trade receivables and other financial assets including deposits with banks. Credit risk \narising from trade receivables is managed in accordance with the Company\u2019s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer \ncredit risk management. \n \nOther financial assets \n \nThis comprises mainly of deposits with banks and other intercompany receivables. Credit risk arising from these financial assets is limited. \n \nTrade receivables \n \nCustomer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company\u2019s established policy and procedures. Trade receivables are \nnon-interest bearing and generally have a credit period not exceeding 90 days. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables \nare limited, due to the customer base being large and diverse. All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on a quarterly basis. \nHistorical experience of collecting receivables of the Company is supported by low level of past default and hence the credit risk is perceived \nto be low. \n \nFinancial instruments and cash deposits \n \nCredit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company's finance department in accordance with the \nCompany\u2019s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties. \n \n(e) Liquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments \nthat are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close \nto its fair value. The Company's objective is to, at all times maintain optimum levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements. \nThe Company closely monitors its liquidity position and deploys a robust cash management system. It maintains adequate sources of financing \nfrom both banks and financial institutions at an optimised cost. \n \nThe table below analysis non-derivative financial liabilities of the Company into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period \nfrom the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed under the ageing buckets are the contractual undiscounted \ncash flows and includes contractual interest payments. \n \n",

Leases \n \nA. Operating lease commitments - Company as lessee \n \nThe Company\u2019s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for Office & Other Building. The Company recognises right-of-use asset \nrepresenting its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured \nat inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before \nthe commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the \nlessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use assets \nis subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any \nremeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over \nthe shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis \nas those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying \namounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Company measures the lease \nliability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted \nusing the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses \nincremental borrowing rate. The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets \nthat have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with \nthese leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n \n",

Some of the more important factors are discussed below, as well as in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d on page 27 . \n1. Condition of the markets that we operate in \nAs an export-oriented company, our financial performance is closely linked to the condition of the global markets we \noperate in. International stability, including geopolitical dynamics and economic fluctuations, plays a critical role in \ninfluencing demand for our products and the cost of raw materials. Any significant disruptions, such as trade conflicts or \ndiplomatic tensions, can lead to delays in our supply chain, higher logistics costs, and potential barriers to market access. \nAdditionally, price volatility in both raw materials and finished products is a constant factor affecting our operations. The \ncost of inputs can fluctuate due to supply chain disruptions, speculative activities, or seasonal demand variations, which in \nturn impacts our margins. Simultaneously, shifts in global market trends and competition can affect the pricing of our \nfinished goods, creating pressure on profitability. Moreover, the trade relations and policies of the countries we do business \nwith are pivotal to our success. Changes in tariff structures, regulatory environments, or the introduction of protectionist \nmeasures can impact market access and cost structures. Conversely, favourable trade agreements present opportunities for \ngrowth by enhancing our competitive positioning in key markets. We continuously monitor these developments to adapt \nto the evolving international landscape and mitigate potential risks. \n2. Costs of raw materials and other inputs \nOur principal raw materials and products purchased to integrate with our systems include PVC resin and chemicals needed \nfor our proprietary mixes that are used in our products. Our Cost of Goods Sold, which is the aggregate of our cost of \nmaterials consumed, purchase of stock-in-trade and changes in inventories of finished goods and work-in-progress, makes \nup a large portion of our operating expenses. For the Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, our Cost of Goods Sold \namounted to, \u20b9 1,461.26 million, \u20b9 1,797.08 million and \u20b9 1,402.10 million respectively, or, 35.83%, 44.13% and 55.96% \nof our total income, respectively.

The price and availability \nof resins are subject to market volatility due to factors beyond our control, including changes in crude oil prices, supply \nchain disruptions, geopolitical events, and natural disasters. Any sustained increase in resin prices could substantially raise \nour production costs. We currently rely on imported raw materials for a significant majority of our raw material \nrequirements.

        "full_text": " \n \n \n287 \nThe import of certain of our raw materials is regulated by the various regulatory requirements, which empowers the relevant \nauthority to undertake any measures that it deems fit. There can be no assurance such regulations will not become more \nstringent in the future, which could potentially restrict our ability to import raw materials from other jurisdictions.  \nOur competitiveness, manufacturing costs, and profitability depend, in part, on our ability to source and maintain a stable \nand sufficient supply of raw materials. We currently have multiple suppliers for each of our raw materials and while we do \nnot enter into long-term supply contracts, we have not experienced any disruptions in our supplies. Further, with most of \nour raw material suppliers, we source raw materials from such third-party suppliers on a purchase order basis where the \npricing is typically negotiated for each purchase order on the basis of several factors including the prevailing prices of such \nraw materials in international markets. There can be no assurance that, in the event of an increase in our raw material \nrequirements, or any decrease in availability of such raw materials with our suppliers, we may not be able to procure \nadequate raw materials in a timely manner. In addition, the price and availability of such raw materials depend on various \nfactors beyond our control, including overall economic conditions, foreign exchange rates, production levels, market \ndemand and competition for such materials, production and transportation costs, duties and taxes and trade and regulatory \nrestrictions. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new or continue our existing \narrangements with our raw materials suppliers on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could have an adverse effect \non our ability to source raw materials in a commercially viable and timely manner, if at all, which may impact our business \noperations and financial performance. \n3. Supply chain disruptions and logistics \nOur business is highly dependent on a stable and efficient supply chain to source raw materials and deliver finished products \nto international markets. Any disruption in this chain can adversely affect our operations, timelines, and profitability. \nFactors such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, global pandemics, and transportation bottlenecks have the potential \nto cause delays or interruptions in the supply of key materials. These disruptions may lead to increased production costs, \nreduced manufacturing efficiency, or even temporary suspension of operations. Logistics also plays a vital role in ensuring \nthe timely delivery of our products to clients across the globe. The availability and cost of transportation, including shipping \nrates and fuel costs, are subject to external factors such as fluctuating demand, regulatory changes, and capacity constraints \nin global freight networks. Our suppliers undertake the delivery of our raw materials and we rely on third party logistic \ncompanies and freight forwarders to deliver our products. We typically do not have formal contractual relationships with \nsuch logistic companies and freight forwarders. Set forth below are our freight and handling charges (that include sea \nfreight charges, clearing and forwarding expenses, and transportation expense) for each of the Fiscals: \nParticular \nFiscal 2022 \nFiscal 2023 \nFiscal 2024 \nAmount \n(\u20b9 million) \nPercentage of \nrevenue from \noperations \n(%) \nAmount \n(\u20b9 million) \nPercentage of \nrevenue from \noperations \n(%) \nAmount \n(\u20b9 million) \nPercentage \nof revenue \nfrom \noperations \n(%) \nFreight and handling charges \n(that \ninclude \nsea \nfreight \ncharges, \nclearing \nand \nforwarding \nexpenses, \nand \ntransportation expense) \n454.14 \n18.12 \n743.85 \n18.26 \n460.05 \n11.28 \n \nDelays in shipping schedules, port congestion, or customs clearance processes can negatively impact our ability to meet \ncustomer deadlines, potentially leading to financial penalties, loss of business, or reputational damage. To mitigate these \nrisks, we actively monitor our supply chain and logistics network, work with multiple suppliers, and seek to diversify our \nsourcing strategies. We also maintain close relationships with logistics partners to ensure flexibility and responsiveness in \nnavigating unexpected disruptions. \n4. Manufacturing Facilities \nAs on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have four facilities located in Udaipur, Rajasthan. For details, refer \nto \u201cOur Business \u2013 Facilities\u201d on page 181. Of these, we utilise two of our facilities for manufacturing which have fungible \ncapacities that can cater to our product range. Our business is dependent on our ability to efficiently manage our \nmanufacturing facilities and operations facilities and the operational risks associated with it, including those beyond our \nreasonable control. Any unscheduled, unplanned or prolonged disruption of our manufacturing operations, including on \naccount of power failure, fire, mechanical failure of equipment, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, \nobsolescence, non-availability of adequate labour or disagreements with our workforce, lock-outs, earthquakes and other \nnatural disasters, industrial accidents, any significant social, political or economic disturbances or infectious disease \noutbreaks, could reduce our ability to meet the conditions of our contracts and adversely affect sales and revenues from \noperations in such fiscal period.

Dependence on Exports \nIn Fiscal 2022, 2023 and 2024, we exported our products outside India in 15 countries. Our revenue from operations from \nexport markets was \u20b9 3,355.52 million representing 82.27% of our revenue from operations in Fiscal 2024.

We believe establishing a presence in such international markets would facilitate our sales, \nmarketing and business development activities and provide us with timely insights into the economic, product requirements \nand regulatory environment in such markets. The risks involved in entering new geographic markets and expanding \noperations, may be higher than expected, and we may face significant competition in such markets. In the eventuality we \nare unable to successfully expand into new geographical regions, our growth plans and future performance shall be \nadversely affected. By expanding into new geographical regions, we could be subject to additional risks associated with \nestablishing and conducting operations, including compliance with a wide range of laws, regulations and practices; \nexposure to expropriation or other government actions; and political, economic and social instability. \n6. Working capital requirements and access to capital resources \nOur relationship with our customers is generally on a non-exclusive basis. We conduct business with our customers \nprimarily on the basis of purchase orders that are placed from time to time. Consequently, there is no commitment on the \npart of such customers to continue to place new purchase orders with us and as a result, our revenue and consequent cash \nflow may fluctuate significantly from time to time. The fluctuation in demand for our products may either require us to \nincrease production or decrease production and inventories at short notice, which may result in us bearing additional costs \nand incurring losses. While we maintain a reasonable level of inventory of raw materials, work in progress and finished \nproducts, if we underestimate demand or have inadequate capacity due to which we are unable to meet the demand for our \nproducts, we may end up manufacturing lesser quantities of products than required, which could result in the loss of \nbusiness. At times when we have overestimated demand, we may have incurred costs to build capacity or purchased more \nraw materials and manufactured more products than required. Our inability to accurately forecast demand for our products \nand manage our inventory may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial \ncondition. The table below sets forth details of certain parameters as of the dates indicated:  \nParticulars \nUnit \nFiscal 2024 \nFiscal 2023 \nFiscal 2022 \nWorking Capital Cycle \nDays \n84.98 \n52.22 \n38.07 \nInventory Days \nDays \n50.95 \n35.98 \n47.13 \nDebtor Days \nDays \n60.87 \n49.65 \n43.35 \nPayable Days \nDays \n26.84 \n33.41 \n52.40 \n \nWe evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated demand \nbased on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product sales mix. Efficient inventory management is a key \ncomponent for the success of our business. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an \nappropriate product sales mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands, without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent \nthat the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely affects our results of operations.

Our working capital requirements may increase if \npayment terms shift to payments on completion of delivery or otherwise increase our working capital burdens. In addition, \nour working capital requirements have increased in recent years due to the general growth of our business. If a customer \ndefaults in making its payment on a product to which we have devoted significant resources, it may also affect our \nprofitability and liquidity and decrease the capital resources that are otherwise available for other uses. All of these factors \nmay result in increases in our working capital requirements. If we are unable to finance our working capital needs, or secure \nother financing when needed, on acceptable commercial terms or at all, it may adversely affect our business, growth \nprospects and results of operations. \n7. General and Indian economic conditions \nWe are affected by general global and Indian economic conditions. Our performance and growth will depend to a large \nextent on the health of the economies in which we operate. While our Company is incorporated in India and our \nmanufacturing facilities are based in India, our products are sold in, among other regions, India, the United States of \nAmerica and other parts of the world. We are, therefore, dependent on domestic, regional and global economic and market \nconditions of the markets in which we operate or intend to operate. Our business, results of operation and financial condition \ncould be influenced by factors such as inflation, access to capital and borrowing costs, trade policies in terms of tariff and \nnon-tariff barriers, India\u2019s trade deficit, fluctuations in global commodity prices and fluctuations in India\u2019s foreign \nexchange reserves or currency exchange rates, among others. India is the 5th largest country with a GDP (at current prices) \nof US$3.5 trillion, despite the pandemic and despite inheriting an economy with macro imbalances and a broken financial \nsector. In the next three years, India is expected to become the third-largest economy in the world, with a GDP of US$5 \ntrillion (estimated). If the prognosis for 2025 turns out to be right, that will mark the fourth-year post-pandemic that the \nIndian economy will have grown at or over 7%. The growing strength in both domestic and external demand has sustained \nthe response of the various sectors on the supply side. India\u2019s real GDP or GDP at constant price value stood at Rs. 174 \nlakh cr. in FY 2024 has grown by 8.2% compared to the growth of 7% in FY 2023. Nominal GDP of GDP at current prices \nis estimated to be Rs. 295 lakh cr. in FY 2024 with a growth of 9.6% from Rs. 270 lakh cr. in FY 2023. \n8. Seasonality  \nOur sales have historically exhibited certain seasonal fluctuations, reflecting a slight dip in sales volumes and profit margins \nduring lean season for building materials, especially in our export markets. For instance, during harsh weather conditions, \nthe demand for building materials in certain sections of our USA markets and EU markets may witness a decline due to \nextreme weather conditions. While we maintain our production levels and inventory to account for this seasonality, our \nfixed costs such as lease rentals, employee salaries, store operating costs and logistics-related expenses, which form a \nsignificant portion of our operating costs, are relatively constant throughout the year. Consequently, lower than expected \nsales during certain quarters of the fiscal year or more pronounced seasonal variations in sales in the future could have a \ndisproportionate impact on our operating results for the fiscal year or could strain our resources and significantly impair \nour cash flows. Further, as a result of the above, our quarter-on-quarter financial results may not be comparable or a \nmeaningful indicator of our futuristic performance. Any slowdown in demand for our products during peak seasons or \nfailure by us to accurately anticipate and prepare for such seasonal fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. While we have not faced any such slowdown in demand or failure \nto accurately anticipate for seasonal fluctuations, we cannot assure that we will not face this in the future. \nMaterial Accounting Policies for the Restated Consolidated Financial Information \nThe material accounting policies as set forth in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been reproduced below. \n1. Functional and presentation currency \nThese Restated Consolidated Financial Information are presented in \u20b9, which is also functional currency of the Company. \nAll amounts disclosed in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information and notes have been rounded off to the nearest \n\u201cmillion\u201d with two decimals, unless otherwise stated. \n2. Use of estimates \nThe preparation of Restated Consolidated Financial Information in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to \nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as at the Balance Sheet date, \nreported amount of revenue and expenditure for the period and disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the Balance Sheet \ndate.

Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents are assets that \nare intended to be realized, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Company. Based on the nature of \nproducts and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, \nthe company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets \nand liabilities. \n4. Revenue recognition \n4.1. Revenue from contract with customers is recognised when the Company satisfies performance obligation by transferring \npromised goods to the customer. Performance obligations are satisfied at the point of time when the customer obtains \ncontrols of the asset.  \nRevenue is measured based on transaction price, which is the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, stated \nnet of discounts, returns and goods and services tax. Transaction price is recognised based on the price specified in the \ncontract, net of the estimated sales incentives/ discounts. \n4.2. Provision for sales returns are estimated on the basis of historical experience, market conditions and specific contractual \nterms and provided for in the year of sale as reduction from revenue. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate \nreturns are monitored and adjusted regularly in line with contractual and legal obligations, trade practices and projected \nmarket conditions. \n4.3.

Non-Financial Asset \nThe carrying amount of non-financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to ascertain whether there is any indication \nof impairment. If any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is \nrecognized, as an expense in the statement of profit and loss, for the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds \nits recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset fair value less cost to sale and value in use. Value \nin use is ascertained through discounting of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the current \nmarket assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the assets. \nAn impairment loss is reversed if there is any change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An \nimpairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that \nwould have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment has been recognized. \n9. Inventories \n9.1. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of raw materials, packing materials and stores, \nspares and consumables includes all charges incurred in bringing the goods to the warehouse, including any levies, transit \ninsurance and receiving charges.  \n9.2. Costs of Finished Goods and Work-in-Progress are determined on specific identification basis by taking material cost net \nof GST, labour and relevant appropriate overheads. Cost of raw materials and packing material are determined on specific \nidentification basis by taking material cost net of GST. \n10. Cash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and at banks, short-term deposits (with an original maturity of three \nmonths or less from the date of acquisition), and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose \nof statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term deposits, as defined above, net of \noutstanding book overdrafts , if any, as they are considered an integral part of the company's cash management. \n11. Borrowing Costs \nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized \nduring the period of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. A qualifying asset \nis one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are \ncharged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. \n12. Earnings Per Share \nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by \nthe weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is the same as basic \nearnings per share as the company does not have any dilutive potential equity shares outstanding. The number of equity \nshares are adjusted for share splits and bonus shares, as appropriate. \n13. Taxes on Income \nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax expense. Income tax expenses are recognized in statement of profit \nand loss, except when they relate to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, \nincome tax expenses are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. \nCurrent tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end \nof reporting period by the governing taxation laws, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Income \ntax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. \nManagement periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax \nregulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. \nDeferred taxes arising from deductible and taxable temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and \ntheir carrying amount in the financial statements are recognized using substantively enacted tax rates and laws expected to \napply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.

Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets \n14.1. Provisions \nProvisions are recognized only when there is a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow \nof resources will be required to settle the obligation in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made.  \n14.2. Contingent liability  \nIt is disclosed for \n14.2.1. Possible obligations which will be confirmed only by future events not wholly within the control of the company, \nor \n14.2.2. Present obligations arising from past events where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required \nto settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. \n14.3. Contingent Assets \nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the \noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. \nContingent assets are not recognised and disclosed only when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. \n15. Leases \n\"The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 \"Leases\"\". At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, \nor contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified \nasset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \nThe Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date except for leases with a \nterm of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the lease \npayments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a written down \nvalue basis over the lease term. Lease term is a non-cancellable period together with periods covered by an option to extend \nthe lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the \nlease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. \nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for \nany lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of \ncosts to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less \nany lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the written down value method from \nthe commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the \nCompany by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase \noption. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. In addition, the \nright-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease \nliability. \nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid over the lease term at the \ncommencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, \nthe Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount \nrate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\" \nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified \nas financing cash flows. \n16. Foreign currency transactions and translation: \nTransactions in foreign currencies entered into by the Company are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing at the \ndate of transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities remaining unsettled at the end of the year are translated \nat the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the year. All differences arising on settlement/restatement are adjusted in the \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n",

Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that \nwe will have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without \nincurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. \nOur management monitors rolling forecasts of our liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected \ncash flows to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.

International stability, including geopolitical dynamics and economic fluctuations, plays a critical role in influencing demand \nfor our products and the cost of raw materials. Any significant disruptions, such as trade conflicts or diplomatic tensions, can \nlead to delays in our supply chain, higher logistics costs, and potential barriers to market access. Additionally, price volatility \nin both raw materials and finished products is a constant factor affecting our operations. The cost of inputs can fluctuate due to \nsupply chain disruptions, speculative activities, or seasonal demand variations, which in turn impacts our margins. \nSimultaneously, shifts in global market trends and competition can affect the pricing of our finished goods, creating pressure \non profitability. Moreover, the trade relations and policies of the countries we do business with are pivotal to our success. \nChanges in tariff structures, regulatory environments, or the introduction of protectionist measures can impact market access \nand cost structures. Conversely, favourable trade agreements present opportunities for growth by enhancing our competitive \npositioning in key markets. We continuously monitor these developments to adapt to the evolving international landscape and \nmitigate potential risks. \nCapital risk management \nOur objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for \nshareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In \norder to maintain or adjust the capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to \nshareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. \n",

Under \nthe Industrial Policy, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the Indian economy \nup to any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain prescribed procedures \nfor making such investment.  \nThe RBI and the concerned ministries/departments are responsible for granting approval for foreign investment.  \nThe Government has from time to time made policy pronouncements on FDI through press notes and press releases. The \nDepartment for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India (earlier \nknown as Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion) (\u201cDPIIT\u201d), issued the FDI Policy, which is effect from October 15, \n2020, which subsumes and supersedes all previous press notes, press releases and clarifications on FDI issued by the DPIIT \nthat were in force and effect prior to October 15, 2020. The FDI Policy will be valid until the DPIIT issues an updated circular. \nFDI in companies engaged in sectors/ activities which are not listed in the FDI Policy is permitted up to 100% of the paid up \nshare capital of such company under the automatic route, subject to compliance with certain prescribed conditions. For further \ndetails, see \u201cKey Regulations and Policies\u201d on page 190. \nFurther, in accordance with Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series), dated April 17, 2020 issued by the DPIIT and the Foreign Exchange \nManagement (Non-debt Instruments) Amendment Rules, 2020 which came into effect from April 22, 2020, any investment, \nsubscription, purchase or sale of equity instruments by entities of a country which shares land border with India or where the \nbeneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country (\u201cRestricted Investors\u201d), will \nrequire prior approval of the Government, as prescribed in the FDI Policy and the FEMA Rules. Further, in the event of transfer \nof ownership of any existing or future foreign direct investment in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the \nbeneficial ownership falling within the aforesaid restriction/ purview, such subsequent change in the beneficial ownership will \nalso require approval of the Government. Pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) (Fourth \nAmendment) Rules, 2020, issued on December 8, 2020, a multilateral bank or fund, of which India is a member, shall not be \ntreated as an entity of a particular country nor shall any country be treated as the beneficial owner of the investments of such \nbank or fund in India. Each Bidder should seek independent legal advice about its ability to participate in the Offer. In the event \nsuch prior approval of the Government of India is required, and such approval has been obtained, the Bidder shall intimate our \nCompany and the Registrar to the Offer in writing about such approval along with a copy thereof within the Offer Period. \nThe transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a non-resident does not require the prior approval of the RBI, provided \nthat (i) the activities of the investee company are under the automatic route under the FDI policy and transfer does not attract \nthe provisions of the Takeover Regulations; (ii) the non-resident shareholding is within the sectoral limits under the FDI policy; \nand (iii) the pricing is in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the SEBI/RBI. \nIn terms of the FEMA Rule and the FDI Policy, a person resident outside India may make investments into India, subject to \ncertain terms and conditions, and further provided that an entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the \nbeneficial owner of an investment into India, who is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, shall invest only with the \napproval of the Government of India. Further, in the event of transfer of ownership of any existing or future foreign direct \ninvestment in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the above restriction/ \npurview, such subsequent change in the beneficial ownership will also require approval of the Government of India. Each \nBidder should seek independent legal advice about its ability to participate in the Offer. In the event such prior approval of the \nGovernment is required, and such approval has been obtained, the Bidder shall intimate our Company and the Registrar in \nwriting about such approval along with a copy thereof within the Offer Period. \nForeign Exchange Laws \nThe foreign investment in our Company is governed by, inter-alia, the FEMA, the FEMA Rules, the FDI Policy issued and \namended by way of press notes. \nPursuant to the resolution dated September 6, 2024, the aggregate investment limit by NRIs and OCIs was increased from 10% \nto 24% of the paid-up equity share capital of our Company, provided however, that the shareholding of each NRI or OCI shall \nnot exceed 5% of the total paid-up equity capital of our Company on a fully diluted basis and the total holdings of all NRIs and \nOCIs put together shall not exceed 10% of the total paid-up equity capital on a fully diluted basis. \nPursuant to the FDI Policy, FDI of up to 100% is permitted under the automatic route in our Company. \nAs per the existing policy of the Government, OCBs cannot participate in this Offer.
